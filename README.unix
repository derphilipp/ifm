Unix version of IFM
*******************

Read the INSTALL file for installation instructions.

IFM has been built and tested on SGIs running IRIX 5.3 and 6.2 with gcc,
GNU/Linux with gcc, and Windows 95/NT with Cygnus gcc.  It's also known to
work on Solaris and FreeBSD.  It will probably get up and go on other UNIX
platforms, but hasn't been tried.
