I'm pleased to announce version 5.0 of IFM, the Interactive Fiction Mapper,
which has just been posted to the IF archive.

It's been over 3 years since the last update.  This release is the result
of the gradual accumulation of new features, and I've finally got around to
cleaning things up and documenting all the new stuff.

So, what's new?  Here's a short summary of the main new gimmicks.

* IFM can now dump maps in Fig format.  This means you can edit them using
  Xfig, import them into various other programs that read Fig files, and
  convert the Fig output into lots of other formats.  As a convenience,
  there's a perl script called ifm2dev, which is a front end to fig2dev.

* Another new output format is for Graphviz, a graph drawing program.  IFM
  can write out a task dependency graph to be drawn by Graphviz.

* IFM input is now preprocessed, in a manner similar to C programs.  This
  allows much more flexibility in writing input.

* There are a few new keywords for use in solving the game.  I won't bother
  repeating it all here; details are in the docs.

* The documentation is now distributed in PDF and HTML formats.

* Many other minor additions and some bug-fixes.

And now for the bad news... sadly I can no longer support the Win32 port of
IFM, since I don't have (or want) access to a Windoze box any more.  But if
anyone out there wants to build the Win32 package on their machine and post
it to the IF archive, I'd appreciate it.  You'll need to have the Cygwin
tools installed, and there's some blurb in the source distribution saying
how to do it.

Er... that's it.  Send bug reports, suggestions, big wads of cash, etc., to
zondo@pillock.freeserve.co.uk.
