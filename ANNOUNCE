Announcing IFM version 5.2
**************************

I'm pleased to announce version 5.2 of IFM (Interactive Fiction Mapper).

So, what's new?  Well, not a lot at the moment.  Watch this space.

Er... that's it.  Send bug reports, suggestions, big wads of cash, etc., to
zondo@pillock.freeserve.co.uk.
