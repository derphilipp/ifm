 Announcing IFM v5.3
=====================

Well, it's been over 2 years and the changes have been slowly accumulating,
to the point where it's worth another release.  Here's a mini-FAQ:

What is IFM?
============

IFM (Interactive Fiction Mapper) is a language and a program for keeping
track of your progress through an Interactive Fiction game.  You can record
each room you visit and its relation to other rooms, the initial locations
of useful items you find, and the tasks you need to perform in order to
solve the game.

The IFM mapping commands are designed so that you can easily add to the map
as you explore the game.  You type in the rooms you visit and the
directions you move in to reach other rooms, and IFM calculates the
position of each room relative to the others.  A map can consist of several
independent sections, allowing you to divide up the map however you like.

The IFM task commands, if used, allow you to specify the order in which
game-solving tasks must be done.  The IFM program can then calculate and
print different styles of walkthrough for the game.

Er... yeah, whatever.  So what's new?

That's all fine and dandy, but where do I find it?
==================================================

At the moment, it's here:

   http://www.ifarchive.org/if-archive/unprocessed/ifm-5.3.tar.gz

Or if it's not, it'll have moved here:

   http://www.ifarchive.org/if-archive/mapping-tools

Can I run it on Windows?
========================

Er... no.  Not yet.

As a result of not having a Windows machine (or the inclination to get one)
there currently isn't a Windows IFM v5.3 distribution.  If you want to use
IFM on Windows, you must build it from sources using Cygwin:
http://www.cygwin.com.

If anyone is interested in maintaining a Windows port (or any other port,
for that matter) let me know and I'll keep you informed whenever another
version gets released.  Or alternatively, you could just go ahead: the
current sources are always available (as of, er, last week) at Bitbucket:
