=head1 SYNOPSIS

tkifm [file]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<tkifm> is a graphical front end to ifm(1), the Interactive Fiction
Mapper, written in Tcl/Tk.  It provides a text editing window in which you
map out your game using B<ifm> commands, and a set of menus to view
things.  The various features are as follows:

=over 4

=item Text editing window

This is the main window, where you type B<ifm> commands.  It provides all
the usual text editing command bindings that come with the Tcl/Tk text
widget.

=item File menu

The standard set of file commands: New, Open, Save, Save-as, Quit.  There's
also a command called Redraw, which invokes B<ifm> on the current file
again.  You must use this after doing any changes to your map, or the
changes won't be seen in the other menus.  Any errors or warnings that
occur when invoking B<ifm> will be displayed in a dialog.  Note that
Redraw, if successful, will also destroy all other windows.

=item Map menu

For each map section in your map, a menu entry appears here.  Selecting it
will draw the appropriate map in another window.

=item Item menu

This contains a single menu item, which displays a list of items in another
window.

=item Task menu

This contains a single menu item, which displays a high-level walkthrough
of the game in another window.

=head1 CUSTOMIZATION

On startup, B<tkifm> reads an initialisation file in your home directory
(the one pointed at by the B<HOME> environment variable).  On Unix systems
it is called F<.tkifmrc>, and on Win32 systems it is called F<tkifm.ini>.
From there, using Tcl commands, you can set various things that affect the
appearance of the program.  Here's an example file showing the valid
variables, their format and defaults.

    # Example tkifm init file.

    # Edit window dimensions.
    set ifm(editwidth) 80
    set ifm(editheight) 24

    # Editing font.
    set ifm(editfont) {Courier 12 bold}

    # Edit window colours.
    set ifm(editforeground) black
    set ifm(editbackground) wheat

    # Text window (items and tasks) dimensions.
    set ifm(textwidth) 50
    set ifm(textheight) 30

    # Text window font.
    set ifm(textfont) {Times 12 bold}

    # Text window colours.
    set ifm(textforeground) black
    set ifm(textbackground) wheat
