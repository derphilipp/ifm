the west is a dying forest. Eastward is a vast, grassy plain and the path
also continues southward.

You are on the gravel path. To the east is a vast, grassy plain and the

Rank Forest 
You are in the dying forest; a damp, gloomy place worn by the ravages of
time. The atmosphere is very humid causing the trees to be covered in moss
and fungus. Looking east, you can see a path running along the edge of the
forest. To the south, there is a dotted red line on the ground with dense,
swirling fog beyond. Just in front of the line is a notice board. 
>n
Rank Forest 
You are in a rank, decaying forest, the floor of which is littered with
dead leaves. The atmosphere is very humid causing the trees to be wet and
slippery. Looking east, you can see a pathway running along the edge of
the forest.

Rank Forest 
This is a particularly dark and dreary part of the forest where the undergrowth
is very thick and the trees more densely populated, especially westward,
in which direction any further movement would be impossible.

Rank Forest 
You find yourself in a cold, dark part of the forest where the sinister
shadows fill you with misgivings. Westward, the undergrowth becomes thick

You cannot cross the line as the items you are carrying seem to hold you
back.

Rank Forest 
This is a part of the forest where the humidity has caused the undergrowth
to be covered in a thin layer of mildew. The overpowering odour fills your
nostrils, prompting nausea. Looking southward, you can see a dotted red
line on the ground, beyond which is a dense, swirling fog. Just in front
of the line is a notice board. There is also a large tree here that looks
climbable.

Forest Clearing 
You have stumbled upon a clearing in the forest, the middle of which is
covered in a vibrant, green turf. However, the trees around the edge of

Uncultivated Hills

Foothills 
You find yourself in the foothills below the nearest of the snow-capped
mountains which looms up ominously in front of you. Around you, the floor
is strewn with massive boulders. The only exits are south, along the gravel
path, and a track leading northwest up the side of the mountain. Which is
blocked by a particularly large boulder.

Large Hill 
You are on a large hill covered in clumps of wild heather atop which is

Inside The Hut 
You are now inside a dingy old mud hut. A shaven-headed guru wearing an
orange robe sits cross-legged in the centre of the floor with a cupboard
behind him. Also, a small bowl, full of rice, is on the floor in front of
the guru. As you enter, he stands, bows to you and sits again.
The guru notices your wristband and breaks out into uncontrollable laughter.

Grassy Plain

is here. He has a friendly air as he tries to sell you his goods from the
back of a wooden cart pulled by a mangy old donkey.
"Ah, here's a likely customer", he says with a confident patter, "Are you
on a quest?" And without waiting for an answer, "Then you'll need to get
kitted out and I've got just the things:
Some iron rations for those peckish moments on dungeon journeys, for only
1 ferg. Some silver armour worthy of any true adventurer, for only 2 fergs.
A bottle of whisky distilled by the highly acclaimed Roobikyoub tribe of
dwarfs, for only 2 fergs. Some sparkling spring water from the exclusive
Obakanga valley in southern Kerovnia, for only 1 ferg. A bottle of Farthington's
real ale (complete with twigs and sediment), for only 1 ferg. I don't accept
credit even if it's good (it's a matter of principle).

You can't go that way.
Only east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest.

As you pass, Honest John complains, "Not going to buy anything, eh? Well,
you're hardly going to succeed in your quest without any equipment, are
you?"
Grassy Wilderness 
You find yourself in a vast wilderness of grassy plain extending to the
limit of your vision in every direction. 
Kronos the magician zooms past on a circular stone platform that hovers
above the ground, executes a steep, banked turn and glides to a halt in
front of you.
"Greetings, stranger", Kronos says in a deep, rich voice.

The magician then offers you a sealed note.
