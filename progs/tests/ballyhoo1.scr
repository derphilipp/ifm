In the Wings
The big top can be entered to the north and exited to the south. To the
northeast, the grandstand begins its precipitous rise.

>ne
Climbing up into the deserted and littered grandstands produces a disorienting
sense of deja vu. You make a headachy descent down the steps.

>s
You emerge into the warm night air of summer.

Connection
This area of matted-down crabgrass lies between the vaulted big top entrance to
the north and the enticements of the midway to the east, where a sagging banner
hangs crookedly above a turnstile. There is a drinking fountain near the side
wall of the tent. You can enter the night to the west and south.

The last of the crowd just now trickles eastward through the turnstile.

A midget decked out in a Russian general's uniform is standing before the
drinking fountain.

>item "midget"
[I don't know the word "item."]

>lift midget
Once elevated, Comrade Thumb slurps his fill of water. He then plops down, gives
you a quick salute, and waddles off into the darkness.

Soiled by endless miles of travel and heavily patched in places, the wide

Beside the Big Top
You're standing next to the big top, which is gently flapping in the warm
breeze.

A cheap plastic clown mask, having been carelessly dropped here, is lying
face-up on the ground.

About waist-high, a barred passage for wild animals extends several yards out
from the big top.

Back Yard
You're standing in front of the turnstile entrance to a fenced-in area, which is
south. To the west stands a droopy tent, and the field continues north and east.

A tall and lanky clown in baggy pants trudges out of the tent and toward the
turnstile. Comrade Thumb follows behind.

Adjacent to the turnstile to your south is a vertical cage.

>z
Time passes...

The tall clown, whom you now recognize as Chuckles, barks a hello into the cage.
You hear an electronic buzz from the turnstile and Chuckles passes through.

>examine cage
The fire-damaged cage, perhaps once the home of some big jungle cat, has been
converted into some kind of vertical booth.

Comrade Thumb performs an impromptu handstand.

Comrade Thumb belts out a few verses of a Russian folk song in his high-pitched,
squeaky voice while standing on his head.

Inside Prop Tent
This dimly lighted tent houses a ragtag collection of outrageous props and wacky
devices, including a midget automobile that's garaged in here.

Lying here in a heap is a gorilla suit.

President William Howard Taft is here.

You can hear muffled voices coming from outside and see two ominous shadows cast
against the side wall of the tent.

>item "gorilla suit" tag Suit
[I don't know the word "item."]

>item "cardboard cutout" tag Cutout
[I don't know the word "item."]

>hide behind taft
You crouch behind the cardboard character.

From behind the figure of President Taft you hear footsteps enter the tent, a
pause, then hushed conversation.

>listen
[What do you want to listen to?]

>conversation
"So, Munrab, what is it? Why have you called me here?"
  
"Listen, Detective, I've had a terrible day in your lousy little town, so let me
be brief. Receipts have been down all month, tonight's concession stand sales
were especially small, the towners were tightfisted, they nearly leveled my
grandstand, and on top of that somebody's kidnapped my daughter, Chelsea. That's
where you come in. Here's the most recent picture of her -- a pretty good
likeness in my opinion."

"Mr. Munrab, why are we whispering?"

>task "Hide behind cutout" tag Hide
[I don't know the word "task."]

>task "Listen to conversation" tag Listen after last
[I don't know the word "task."]

>z
Time passes...

"I don't know, because it's a mystery I guess. Anyhow, it's not because I
suspect any of my own people here on the lot." There's a pause. "I've got a
pretty loyal crew here. Sure, I work the guys a fair amount, but hey, no one
joins the circus expecting a holiday."

Lacking all passion and professionalism, the detective replies, "I'll suspect
who you want me to suspect. You're paying the bill."

"Here, see, the language of this ransom note clearly shows that it's not an
inside job. Detective, I don't know what kind of crazies are running loose in
this town, but I'm afraid harm might come to my daughter if the police were to
show up. God knows this circus doesn't need that kind of publicity, anyway. So
I'm relying on you and you alone."

"I'd better hold on to that note, Munrab."

"Alright, then get going."

You can hear Mr. Munrab and the detective hustle out of the tent. You stand up.

The tiny car, just a slice of lemon, is in pretty bad shape. It smells of
gasoline and burnt oil.

Only a basket case or a child would fit in there.

Near White Wagon
You are standing on a gentle upslope of the grassy field, next to a rather
imposing trailer whose door is closed to the east. In dark panorama, the field
continues north and west -- and south, where a large banner has been erected.

Part of a narrow pole is sticking out from under the wagon.

A roustabout who is wearing a pair of headphones and carrying a large net over
his shoulder passes you and exits the big top.

Under the Bleachers
You're standing between the underside of the grandstand and the side wall of the
big top. Not unexpectedly, the ground here is strewn with garbage. The only exit
is southwest.

Performance Ring
This is the arena's oval-shaped performance ring which appears deathly quiet
without its circus atmosphere. Also missing is its safety net. A rope ladder
dangles to within a foot of the ground.

Just west lies the entrance to a large, round cage that completely encircles the
second of the two rings. To the south the big top's vaulted wing leads out into
the open air. The arena's rickety grandstands rise steeply north and east.
