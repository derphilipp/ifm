Up a Tree
You are about 10 feet above the ground nestled among some large branches. The
nearest branch above you is above your reach.
Beside you on the branch is a small bird's nest.
In the bird's nest is a large egg encrusted with precious jewels, apparently
scavenged by a childless songbird. The egg is covered with fine gold inlay, and
ornamented in lapis lazuli and mother-of-pearl. Unlike most eggs, this one is
hinged and closed with a delicate looking clasp. The egg appears extremely
fragile.

Canyon View
You are at the top of the Great Canyon on its west wall. From here there is a
marvelous view of the canyon and parts of the Frigid River upstream. Across the
canyon, the walls of the White Cliffs join the mighty ramparts of the Flathead
Mountains to the east. Following the Canyon upstream to the north, Aragain Falls
may be seen, complete with rainbow. The mighty Frigid River flows out from a
great dark cavern. To the west and south can be seen an immense forest,
stretching for miles around. A path leads northwest. It is possible to climb
down into the canyon from here.

>e
Rocky Ledge
You are on a ledge about halfway up the wall of the river canyon. You can see
from here that the main flow from Aragain Falls twists along a passage which it
is impossible for you to enter. Below you is the canyon bottom. Above you is
more cliff, which appears climbable.

>d
Canyon Bottom
You are beneath the walls of the river canyon which may be climbable here. The
lesser part of the runoff of Aragain Falls flows by below. To the north is a
narrow path.

>n
End of Rainbow
You are on a small, rocky beach on the continuation of the Frigid River past the
Falls. The beach is narrow due to the presence of the White Cliffs. The river
canyon opens here and sunlight shines in from above. A rainbow crosses over the
falls to the east and a narrow path continues to the southwest.
