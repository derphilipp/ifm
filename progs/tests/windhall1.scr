"The Path to Fortune" is now in its "verbose" mode, which always gives long
descriptions of locations (even if you've been there before).

>title "Windhall Chronicles"
You what?

>l

Central Windhall
     You stand in the midst of the small city of Windhall. The road runs along
north and south from here. To the west is Sir Gunther's small house, and to the
east lies Baezil's Bakery. You can almost taste all the delicious pastries that
Baezil bakes fresh every day.

Baezil's Bakery
You stand in the cool confines of Baezil's bakery, but something is amiss. The
oven, which usually at this time of day is full of cooking delights, now lies
empty and lifeless, and no delicacies line the many trays along the counter.

Baezil stoops over his oven, cursing it loudly.

On the counter are a handful of habba nuts, a clump of light-colored dough and a
clump of dark-colored dough.

Sir Gunther's House
     You stand in the small cottage that Sir Gunther IX has taken up residence
in. It was the first thing built when the town was settled, and its age is
starting to show. The room is simply furnished, more due to lack of funds than
lack of want. This is one of the few times you've ever been in here, for few
visit Sir Gunther on a regular basis.

An old, battered wastebasket sits next to Sir Gunther's writing desk.

Sir Gunther is seated at his desk, shuffling though some of his "important"
papers, which he keeps well-hidden from your sight. He glances up as you enter.

"Yes? And what arest THOU doing here?"

It's pretty obvious he's still more than a bit peeved about your being chosen
for the quest over him.

>x basket
Sir Gunther's wastebasket is made of poor-quality wood, and has many chips in
it.

>look in it
The wastebasket is empty.

>x papers
You catch a glimpse of the "important" papers, which turn out to be useless
doodles and little notes Sir Gunther writes to himself, reminding him of how
great he is.

Southern Windhall
     You stand at the southern end of the small town. To the west lies Borthur's
smithy, your home and workplace. You can feel the heat of the fires within
wafting from the open front door. To the east lies Mayor Mielon and Idah's
house, a pleasant cottage that is always enjoyable to visit. To the south the
road ends in the midst of a small field, and beyond you see the great Forest of
Ansalon. Standing in the middle of the forest, sticking up through the treetops,
looms the tower of Nostrophidius, dark and lonely.

(opening the door to the mayor's house first)

Mielon and Idah's House
     This is the home of the mayor and his wife, and the place where all the
town meetings are held. The fireplace and brick chimney give the room a quaint
coziness, and it is never too hot or too cold. You have spent many days sitting
by the fire and talking to Idah, who never bores you with her many tales.

A long coil of twine lies in the corner.

Mielon is pacing around the table, looking apprehensive.

Idah sits in her chair by the fire, patient and kindly.

A large basket of neatly folded laundry sits in a corner.

North of Forest
     You stand in a small field overlooking the surrounding countryside south of
the town. Rolling hills stretch southwest until they meet with the tree-covered
Tysis Mountains. Standing before the mountains, almost matching their height,
looms the tower of Nostrophidius. To the southeast, the great forest of Ansalon
stretches to the horizon.

>se

Forest Path
     The easy forest path here is well worn from use by the townspeople and
forest animals. To the east the path has a smaller, lesser-used split, rounding
to the southeast. The latter path goes far deeper into the forest while the main
path to the east skirts around the edge.

>e

Grassy Glen
     You stand in a small glen near the edge of the Forest of Ansalon. Trees
skirt around the glen, blocking any attempts to see where it is you're headed.
As you walk into the clearing you feel a strange sense that someone is watching
your every move, making you edgy about remaining here for a long time. A path
picks up at the eastern side of the clearing, and you think you can manage to
navigate through the trees to the south as well.

>e

Giant Tree
     A giant ikash tree before you stretches almost twice as tall as any other
around it. Its many branches block most of the light and rain from reaching the
ground below it. Thus there is no vegetation underneath the mighty tree. As you
look up from its gnarly base, you get a severe case of vertigo. The giant ikash
leaves hang down, constantly getting in your way. You can see the forest thin
out to both the east and west, and you think you can continue to the southeast
through the nearly impenetrable growth.

>u

Nook
     You are now about halfway up the giant ikash, tucked into a small nook.
Above you the branches thicken, making further climbing impossible. You're too
afraid to look below you for fear that you might see exactly how high up you
are. You were definitely not cut out to be a tree climber.

You can see a bird's nest (in which is an egg) here.

>item "nest"
That's not a verb I recognize.

>item "egg"
That's not a verb I recognize.

>get egg
You pick up the egg.

>x it
It's an ordinary-looking, if somewhat large, egg, but it seems to be divided
into two halves which are sealed onto one another. It has a light-blue tinge to
it, and it feels as if there is something solid within it.

>open it
You try with your callused blacksmith hands to open the fragile egg, but all you
manage to do is shatter the delicate frame into a hundred pieces.

Cliffs of Mydar (1)
     You are on the very edge of the great Cliffs of Mydar. Below the Mydar
Ocean spans out to the horizon, a deep sea of blue. The wind here is gusty,
bringing with it the smells of the sea. To the west the great southern Forest of
Ansalon stretches, blocking any travel that way. A tiny break in the forest
permits passage northwest, and beyond it lies a mammoth tree, dwarfing all those
which grow around it. To the south and northeast the cliffs continue.

I only understood you as far as wanting to examine the south wall.

Cliffs of Mydar (2)
     You are walking along the endless Cliffs of Mydar. Far below, the Mydar
Ocean extends to the east as far as you can see. You can smell the salt water
from this height and see the waves as they crash into the rocks far below. To
the northwest you see the Forest of Ansalon and realize that you've never been
south of the forest before.  You think you can manage to get through the
forest's overgrowth. Great grasslands stretch south until they meet the faraway
Kaskanda Mountains, a fabled range in the south. A small worn path leads
southeast from the impassable rocky outcroppings of the cliffs to the east.

A dark elven bowman stands defiantly, twenty paces away.  He looks as though
he's about to let loose an arrow at you.

>e
As you turn to flee, the dark elf bowman, having no sense of honor, lets loose
his arrow, straight into your back. You take two steps and then realize that
you're dead.

>s

Forest Bend
     The trees in this part of the forest seem to change everywhere you look. A
path here bends from the northwest to the southwest, and it looks well worn. You
also think you see breaks in the underbrush to the north and east.

>e

Forest of Ansalon
     This is the heart of the huge forest. The trees confound your sense of
direction, and make travel almost impossible. You think the underbrush lightens
a bit to the southeast and the south, and you might also be able to forge a path
to the west.

A jittery squirrel darts from tree to tree, carrying a small green stone in its
mouth.

Rocky Plains
     This is the middle ground where the Forest of Ansalon meets the Tysis
Mountains. The forest, dark and oppressive, lies north. To the northwest are
rolling foothills which lead up to the great mountains in the far west. One of
the smaller mountains rises up through the scattered trees to the south.
Westward, in the distance, you can make out the tower of Nostrophidius, matching
the mountains in their glory.

Foothills
     You stand amongst small rolling foothills which block your line of sight
and constantly make you lose your way. You think you can make your way out of
them to the southeast, and to the south what appears to be a plateau rises above
the rocky mounds.

Someone has left a fine quarterstaff wedged between two rocks.

Small Plateau
     You are on a small rise about twenty feet in diameter. From here you can
get a good view of your surroundings. To the west all you can see are mountains
and, in their wake, the great mage's tower. You could descend the plateau to the
north into a great range of foothills, or could also make your way down to the
south, where the plateau meets with one of the smaller mountains. The mighty
forest stretches off to the east.

You'd fall off the plateau if you went that way.

Mountain Base
     This is the very foot of a small mountain which begins ascending to the
southwest. Though you hate heights, you determine that this peak is scalable
even by a novice climber such as yourself.  It's rather hot here, and you enjoy
the little shade that the trees nearby provide.  To the north you can see what
appears to be a plateau, and to the northeast the mountains and hills smooth out
into gentle plains before they meet the forest.

You can see a broken rock here.

Mountain Path
     The path slopes gradually as it leads up one of the smaller of the Tysis
Mountains. Climbing is rather treacherous, more so than it looks, and the sun
beats down on you, making you sweat profusely.  The path winds further up the
mountain to the east. Northeastward, it ends at the base of the mountain. You
can see to the west the snow-capped peaks of the Tysis range. Before the
mountains, almost matching their splendor, stands the tower of Nostrophidius,
dark and uninviting.

>e

Turning Path
     The path here zigs and zags around the mountain, and the constant turns and
twists make you nervous and unsure of your location, as you've never been on
this particular path before. The farther up the path you go, the colder it
becomes. To the east the path abruptly ends before reaching the summit of the
mountain, and to the west it winds its way toward the base.

Directly in front of you, a werewolf and an ogre are locked in a vicious
confrontation.

The werewolf roars in pain as the ogre's fist smashes into its side.

You begin to feel a bit hungry.
