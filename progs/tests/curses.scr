Attic
The attics, full of low beams and awkward angles, begin here in a relatively
tidy area which extends north, south and east. The wooden floorboards seem
fairly sound, just as well considering how heavy all these teachests are. But
the old wiring went years ago, and there's no electric light.

A hinged trapdoor in the floor stands open, and light streams in from below.

>d
Yes, probably just as well to give up looking, and heaven knows there's enough
packing to do, what with the rest of the family in uproar. Oh well.


    *** You have missed the point entirely ***


In that game you scored 0 out of a possible 550, in 3 turns, giving you the rank
of hapless Tourist.

Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, give the FULL score for that
game or QUIT?

Servant's Room
Once upon a time, servants in great houses lived in awful little crevices and
excuses for rooms like this one. They must have been in permanent danger of
suffocation, for there are no windows and only a doorway to the west. A bed is
still kept here, and the sight of it brings on drowsiness in all this warm
stuffy air. All you want to do is curl up and sleep.

There's a little book on the tiny bedside table.

An old striped scarf hangs up behind the doorway.

You can't go that way.

A hinged trapdoor in the floor stands open, and light streams in from below.

>verbose
CURSES is now in its "verbose" mode, which always gives long descriptions of
locations (even if you've been there before).

>s

Old Furniture
Scruffy old furniture is piled up here: armchairs with springs coming out,
umbrella stands, a badly scratched cupboard, a table with one leg missing... You
try to remember why you keep all this rubbish, and fail. Anyway the attic
continues to the southeast.

>se

Over the East Wing
The air is dusty and warm, almost making you choke in this rather empty area.
The attic turns from northwest to east, and there is also a tight doorway
leading west. A short flight of wooden steps leads down and to the south.

Austin, your incorrigible ginger cat, lounges around here.

>s

Disused Observatory
Once upon a time, this small circular room had a dome and a telescope, but it
leaked dreadfully and so now there's a proper roof.

A circular mural painted with the signs of the zodiac is interrupted by a short
flight of stairs leading up to the north, a smoke detector, a west doorway to a
shadowy alcove and the continuation of the stairs down and to the south.

Mounted on the old telescope stand is what looks like a solid glass ball.

>s

Souvenirs Room
This is where you ought to have left the wretched map, in the family lumber-room
of souvenirs and holiday snaps. You checked it thoroughly earlier, and can't
bear the thought of searching it all again. A slide projector is aimed at the
whitewashed south wall, one of the outside walls of the house. The only way to
go is back up to the observatory.

Old Winery
This small cavity at the north end of the attic once housed all manner of
home-made wine paraphernalia, now lost and unlamented. Steps, provided with a
good strong banister rail, lead down and to the west, and the banister rail
continues along a passage east.

You can see a labelled glass demijohn (which is closed) (in which are a
nasty-looking red battery and a tourist map) here.

As you disturb the still air, the attic key, which was balanced on top of the
demijohn, slips onto the floor and disappears into a crack in the floorboards.
Your spirits sink as it does, rattling down some distance. How on earth are you
going to get it back?

>e

Storage Room
A disused storage room off the winery. In one wall is an opening onto an ominous
dark shaft, and beside it is a big Victorian-steam-engine style wheel with a
handle on.

Inside the dark shaft is the old dumbwaiter.

A steel wrench gathers dust in the corner.

Aunt Jemima's Lair
This used to be called the Conservatory, before Aunt Jemima took it over to
potter about with plants, painting and indeed (on occasion) pottery. She has
filled the place with objets trouves and bric-a-brac, and hung up a home-made
calendar of watercolours. Even the old airing cupboard to the south is
cluttered.

An open doorway leads back southwest onto the upstairs landing, and you can hear
the chaotic noise of suitcases being manhandled about - good thing nobody's seen
you. A narrow staircase leads up and to the east into the attic.

Jemima herself seems to be in the potting room to the west.

>w

Potting Room
This light room is full of pot plants, flowers, seeds, ornamental trowels and
other miscellaneous garden implements.

A pair of yellow rubber gloves hangs from a hook on one wall.

Aunt Jemima, who has for years collected varieties of daisy, is engaged in her
regular annual pastime of deciding which species make the best chains.

Airing Cupboard
A space about six feet square. The old drying racks now contain odd ceramic
sculptures almost but not quite unrecognisable as coffee mugs. One corner is
filled with an enormous pile of tie-dyed sheets, from Aunt Jemima's infamous
Sixties Revival period of last October.
