>verbose
Maximum verbosity.

Connection
This area of matted-down crabgrass lies between the vaulted big top entrance to
the north and the enticements of the midway to the east, where a sagging banner
hangs crookedly above a turnstile. There is a drinking fountain near the side
wall of the tent. You can enter the night to the west and south.

Connection
This area of matted-down crabgrass lies between the vaulted big top entrance to
the north and the enticements of the midway to the east, where a sagging banner
hangs crookedly above a turnstile. There is a drinking fountain near the side
wall of the tent. You can enter the night to the west and south.

>i
You have a gorilla suit, your ticket, a clown mask, a balloon and $12.81 to your
name.

>punch blue
You perforate the blue dot.

>put ticket in turnstile
You feed your ticket into the slot and hear all kinds of internal computations
being made, then the ticket rolls out into your hand.

>task "Punch blue dot" need Ticket
[I don't know the word "task."]

>task "Put ticket in turnstile" after last
[I don't know the word "task."]

>e
You pass through the creaky turnstile.

Midway Entrance
To the west is the turnstile exit from the midway, which continues east. The
side of the big top borders on the north. A soiled, sagging banner beckons
south.

Next to the big top, the detective is talking to a pitchman who's carrying an
open trunk that's strapped to his upper body.

>save
Ok.

>listen
[What do you want to listen to?]

>detective
The scratchy recording of a calliope, blaring out from unseen speakers, is
drowning out the voices.

>n
You bump into the side wall of the big top.

The detective examines the label of the flask that he's holding then takes a
slug.

>z
Time passes...

The pitchman gives the detective a final slap on the back and leads him through
the turnstile.

>z
Time passes...

Menagerie
This scrawny patch of dirt offers a square cage on its west side; an open tent
giving off a dank, earthy smell on its east side; and a well-worn path along the
tent to the southeast. A soiled, sagging banner beckons north.

The slow-moving sound of massive chains from inside the tent is heard.

>e
With upraised tusks and flailing trunk, the elephant backs you off.

>se
Menagerie Nook
You are standing outside of the elephant tent. Along its side wall to the north
sits a cage with straw poking out of it. The menagerie is northwest of here.

Facing you on the east side there is a big old plywood sideshow front, faded
beyond recognition. It serves as the barrier wall of an enclosed structure
behind the elephant tent.

>n
The cage door is closed.

>item "cage"
[I don't know the word "item."]

>examine front
The sideshow front is warped and faded beyond recognition.

>move it
You can't move the sideshow front.

Midway of Midway
This is about midway along the midway. Your eyes soak in the lavishly painted
sideshow fronts -- Andrew Jenny's to the south and Rimshaw's to the north. 

>s
Jennifer's Boudoir
This is a cozy little drawing room where guests are received. On the gloomy west
side of the room, a spiral staircase leads upward.

Andrew Jenny is the attraction of this sideshow. He appears standoffish, she's
looking bored.

>item "Andrew Jenny"
[I don't know the word "item."]

>w
You can't go that way.

>u
Andrew goose-steps to a position in front of the spiral staircase, dragging
Jenny's high heel across the ground. There Andrew stands blocking your way up.
Stiffly, he pats his holster a couple of times and you hear its leather crinkle.

>jenny, hello
"Hello."

Hypnotist's Parlor
The parlor, with its tufted black leather sofa, softly lighted chandelier and
darkly varnished paneling strives for a subdued turn-of-the-century motif and is
purposefully dimmed -- thus setting the mood for conveyance, for squinting.

Standing here, attired in an immaculate black tuxedo, is none other than Rimshaw
himself.

>item "Rimshaw"
[I don't know the word "item."]

Far End of Midway
You've reached the far end of the midway. A sideshow front to the north
advertises the "827 Pounds of Feminine Charm" that is Tina.

West Half of Fat Lady
Dominating this once spacious room, geographic in her enormity, mountainous in
her irreducibility, the fat lady sits (though no chair is visible)
breathtakingly to the east. Paths around the attraction lead northeast and
southeast. The exit is south.

East Half of Fat Lady
The fat lady sits (though no chair is visible) breathtakingly to the west. Paths
around the attraction lead northwest and southwest.

There's a stool here.

She appears oblivious to both sight and sound.

The fat lady is wearing a big top, and the expression on her face is sad and
distant, almost Rushmorean.
