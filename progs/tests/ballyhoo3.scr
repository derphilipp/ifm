Standing Room Only
You're in the "blues," sitting high above the arena floor. You know the exit
from the grandstand to be vaguely eastward and down. All around you the crowd is
in a state of pandemonium.

You hear a loud growl nearby.

>listen
[What do you want to listen to?]

>growl
"Rrrrr...grrrrr."

You hear a loud roar nearby.

>w
But you are seated.

You realize the noise is your own stomach.

>stand
As you rise, your row scrunches into the empty space.

A hawker appears at the west end of your row, calling out in a sing-song manner,
"Get your tofu here. Get your yogurt here."

>e
The row of legs pivots away as you scissor awkwardly past.

Standing Room Only
All around you the crowd is in a state of pandemonium. The paths of least
resistance are up, down and west.

Trudging downward, the hawker disappears into the crowd.

Suddenly a hawker appears at the end of the row and you flag him down. The
hawker can barely hear you above the crowd noise. He flashes one finger, then
eight fingers, then five fingers at you, and gestures to pass the money through
the crowd.

Your $1.85 is passed from hand to hand all the way down the row. As the hawker
pockets your money, he's suddenly engulfed by the crowd, which erupts into a
standing ovation. The state of riot panic continues for several anxious moments.

>i
You have $16.56 to your name.

The bank of people above you shouts, in chorus, "Hey, park it!"

The audience settles back down to a state of pandemonium.

>d
You plow your way downward through the crowd all the way into the wings.

In the Wings
The big top can be entered to the north and exited to the south. To the
northeast, the grandstand begins its precipitous rise.

As you exhale a sigh of relief, a smallish and hairy animal inexplicably plops
down upon you from the upper reaches of the big top.

>l
In the Wings
The big top can be entered to the north and exited to the south. To the
northeast, the grandstand begins its precipitous rise.

>i
You have a monkey on your back and $16.56 to your name.

The monkey on your back breathes its jungle breath down your neck.

>get monkey
The animal darts over to your opposite shoulder, piercing your ear with a
shriek.

>lie down
There's no time for that.

The monkey on your back idly grooms areas of your scalp.

>jump
Your feet barely leave the ground.

You are immediately driven out of the ring by a rousing chorus of boos.

Connection
This area of matted-down crabgrass lies between the vaulted big top entrance to
the north and the enticements of the midway to the east, where a sagging banner
hangs crookedly above a turnstile. There is a drinking fountain near the side
wall of the tent. 

Stretching away from a small concession stand is a long line of suckers.

>examine line
You see nothing unusual about the long line.

>join it
[I don't know the word "join."]

>enter line
You are now standing at the tail end of the long line.

>wait
Time passes...

>z
Time passes...

Right next to the long line a much shorter line begins to form.

>z
Time itself, let alone the long line, has ground to an agonizing halt.

>enter short line
You'll have to get out of the long line first.

>stands
[There was no verb in that sentence!]

>stand
You are already standing.

>leave line
[Which line do you mean, the short line or the long line?]

>long
You get out of the long line.

The monkey on your back vocalizes excitedly in your ear.

>enter short
You are now standing at the tail end of the short line.

>z
Time passes...

The face of the man ahead of you lights up as he spots something. "Hey, guys!
It's ME, Jerry," he yells to a sizable group nearby, and they approach.

>z
Time passes...

"Haven't seen you turkeys in years. Howda hell are you guys?" They all
reintroduce themselves. "Hey -- you clowns thirsty? Get in here, I'll buy y'all
beer."

"You sure it's not a problem?" asks the catcher.

"Heck no, just scoot in right here."

With both your resolve and your heaving bosom firm against the crush of
interlopers, you are nevertheless forced to backpedal.

>z
Time passes...

Jerry continues reminiscing with the right fielder.

>z
Time passes...

Jerry continues glad-handing the third baseman.

>z
Time passes...

Jerry continues backslapping the right fielder.

Connection, standing at the tail end of a long line

the north and the enticements of the midway to the east, where a sagging banner
hangs crookedly above a turnstile. There is a drinking fountain near the side
wall of the tent. 

Stretching away from a small concession stand are a short line and a long line
of suckers.

Jerry continues ribbing the right fielder.

>leave long line
You hear an inner voice whisper, "Do I really want to forfeit my position in the
long line?" To which you answer:

>y
You nonchalantly walk away from the long line.

>enter long line
A lot of other people must not have had the same idea as you, as they defect
nearly en masse over to the short line. Steaming to the front of the line, you
get a two-dollar-and-25-cent frozen banana pushed at you and are whisked to the
side before you can even count your change.

The monkey on your back nervously bounces its weight up and down.

>i
You have a two-dollar-and-25-cent frozen banana, a monkey on your back and
$12.81 to your name.

>show banana to monkey
The monkey doesn't seem interested in the two-dollar-and-25-cent frozen banana.

The monkey on your back breathes its jungle breath down your neck.

>eat it
As the monkey on your back catches a whiff of the tangy fruit beneath the
chocolate, you feel its primal heart begin to race and, on the back of your
neck, its warm breath quicken.

The monkey on your back vocalizes excitedly in your ear.

In the Wings
The big top can be entered to the north and exited to the south. To the
northeast, the grandstand begins its precipitous rise.

One lone hawker stands waiting in the wings, taking his break.

>examine hawker
Yup, it's the same guy you encountered in the stands. He's empty-handed and his
uniform resembles modern art, a besplattered canvas of condiments.

The monkey on your back idly grooms areas of your scalp.

It's your standard drinking fountain, with a button next to the spout.

A jet of water hits you square in the eye.

The monkey on your back vocalizes excitedly in your ear.

>throw banana
Following its jungle appetite, the monkey dismounts your back, pounces on the
banana, and saunters away with it.
