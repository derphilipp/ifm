Gateway 
You are at the gatehouse which consists of an archway leading through to
the courtyard of the main palace. Some guards are here. Two burly guards,
armed with pikes, block your entrance.
>examine guards
The guards look very menacing. They proudly wear the emblem of King Erik.

One of the guards says, Hello, what do you want, scum!

>show note to guard
The guards lead you into the palace courtyard for an audience with the king,
who stands in front of you looking very pensive. He takes the note and studies
it intently before giving you his reply:
"Get out of my palace!", He rants, his countenance ablaze with apoplectic
fury. "I will not give in to that evil lizard Kronos."
He screws the note up and stomps off in an abominable rage. The guards lift
you off the ground and unceremoniously dump you outside the palace walls.

Grassy Plain 
This is a vast expanse of grassy plain. To the west is the gravel path,
and the plain extends as far as you can see to the east. Northward, the
terrain becomes rocky and dangerous. Honest John the travelling salesman
is here. He has a friendly air as he tries to sell you his goods from the
back of a wooden cart pulled by a mangy old donkey.
"Ah, here's a likely customer", he says with a confident patter, "Are you
on a quest?" And without waiting for an answer, "Then you'll need to get
kitted out and I've got just the things:
Some iron rations for those peckish moments on dungeon journeys, for only
1 ferg. Some silver armour worthy of any true adventurer, for only 2 fergs.
A bottle of whisky distilled by the highly acclaimed Roobikyoub tribe of
dwarfs, for only 2 fergs. Some sparkling spring water from the exclusive
Obakanga valley in southern Kerovnia, for only 1 ferg. A bottle of Farthington's
real ale (complete with twigs and sediment), for only 1 ferg. I don't accept
credit even if it's good (it's a matter of principle).

Honest John turns away, mumbling something about a wife and three kids to
feed, then gets on his cart and sulks.

Forest Clearing 
You have stumbled upon a clearing in the forest, the middle of which is
covered in a vibrant, green turf. However, the trees around the edge of
the clearing have no leaves and all seem dead or dying. 
There is a tree stump here.

Rank Forest 
This is a part of the forest where the humidity has caused the undergrowth

nostrils, prompting nausea. Looking southward, you can see a dotted red

climbable.

Up The Tree 
You find yourself a long way up the ancient tree. There are an abundance
of twigs and branches that all seem to be brushing against your face. The
branches extend even further above your head but you cannot climb any higher
as there are no more footholds. Set into the west side of the tree trunk
is a small wooden door.
