Central Windhall
     You stand in the midst of the small city of Windhall. The road runs along
north and south from here. To the west is Sir Gunther's small house, and to the
east lies Baezil's Bakery. You can almost taste all the delicious pastries that
Baezil bakes fresh every day.

>n

Northern Windhall
     You stand on the northern edge of the city of Windhall. To the west is
Creston's potion shop, which is more often than not bare of products, and to the
north you can see the small confines of Kytan's shop and house. It seems to
create a dark and gloomy mood in all who look at it, much like its owner. To the
east the road ends abruptly on the outskirts of town. On the distant horizon lie
the mires and wet marshes of the eastern swamplands.

>e

West of Swamp
     You are directly west of the swamps near town. The ground here is muddy and
little grows here but gyal grass and jhaka bushes, making the landscape very
unpleasant. Back to the west, the road into town picks up and winds on to the
horizon, where it meets with Kytan's house. To the east the swamp thickens,
growing more wet and more dangerous. Off to the northeast, you think you hear
the rushing of the Lyndra River.

(opening the door to Creston's potion shop first)

Creston's Shop
     You never did like Creston's potion shop, and now you remember why. It is a
dark, dusty, and very unpleasant place. Cobwebs hang from the ceiling and drape
the shelves and counter. The shop lies, as usual, empty. Creston attributes this
to the difficulties of making a potion, but you think he's just lazy.

"Hey, Aerin," Creston smiles, "I have just the thing to help you on your quest."
Seeing your unenthusiastic expression, he adds, "No, really. Look here."

From below the counter, the alchemist produces a small vial full of a green
liquid. "I've spent a whole week working on this. It's a potion for plant
growth. Great, huh?"

You don't answer. Creston stares lovingly at his potion.

>get vial
You can't see any such thing.

>get liquid
You can't see any such thing.

>item "Creston"
That's not a verb I recognize.

The door to Kytan's trading post seems to be locked.

Which do you mean, Creston's potion shop or Kytan's trading post?

You can't see any such thing.

You can't go that way.

You give the door a few good raps, but no one answers.

West of Swamp
     You are directly west of the swamps near town. The ground here is muddy and
little grows here but gyal grass and jhaka bushes, making the landscape very
unpleasant. Back to the west, the road into town picks up and winds on to the
horizon, where it meets with Kytan's house. To the east the swamp thickens,
growing more wet and more dangerous. Off to the northeast, you think you hear
the rushing of the Lyndra River.

>ne

Near Lyndra River
     This is the small path north of the swamps which takes you to the Lyndra
River, where most of the town's fresh water comes from. A bridge spans the small
river to the northeast, permitting access to the Ivy Coast. Southwestward, the
path ends in the small field east of town. To the south lies one of the many
bogs of the swamplands, blocking your way through.

>s
You'd sink into the bog if you went that way.

>ne

River Bridge
     This is the old but sturdy bridge that spans the Lyndra River. The water
below runs clear and cool, flowing into the dark swamp to the south. The swamp
itself lies dark and dangerous, in wait for another victim. On one side of the
bridge, a path forks off in two directions, the northeastern heading for
Denvil's house, the southeastern bound for the Ivy Coast. To the north all you
can make out are scattered forests and plains, which you have never explored
before, and don't wish to now.

>ne

Small Hollow
     You stand in a small hollow in a diminutive outcropping of trees. The path
here ends at the doorstep of Denvil the wood elf's house, or, more accurately,
his tree. This rather large tree has a door protruding from its huge trunk, and
windows line the trunk all the way to the top. How the tree still continues to
grow, you have no idea. To the southwest you can hear the rushing waters of the
Lyndra River.

A patch of wild flowers grows by the path.

>item "flowers"
That's not a verb I recognize.

>x door
It amazes you how this house was created. Denvil carved it out of a very large
tree, the type of which you've never seen anywhere else. The tree is even now
budding, but you can see that it is hollow through the windows in the trunk. A
door, carved directly into the tree, leads inside. It is currently closed.

>look through window
Windows line the outside of the tree and give you glimpses into the homely
little living place of Denvil.

Denvil must've cut away the lower branches when he put in windows. There's no
way up.

Ivy Coast (1)
     The Ivy Coast is one of the natural wonders of Rysch, so named because, all
around you, ivy covers almost everything you can see until it plummets right
into the ocean. All that lies to the west is a wall of ivy, blocking out your
view of everything beyond. To the east is the Mydar Ocean. The fragrance of salt
assaults your senses.

Your sharp eyes detect a bleached skeleton entangled in the thick ivy.

>x skeleton
From the clothes, it appears the skeleton was once an adventurer. All but the
clothing and bones have rotted away, and ivy has wrapped itself around the
remains, almost totally ensnarling it.

>s

Ivy Coast (2)
     You stand on the beaches of the Ivy Coast. The ivy here grows out of
control, running even into the ocean itself. To the west is a wall of ivy,
blocking out any movement that way. The sound of gulls can be heard over the
crashing of the ocean's waves, and you feel the moist sea air on your skin. To
the far east, you can make out the coastline of the neighboring continent of
Tharkin.

>s

Ivy Coast (3)
     You are walking along the beaches of the Ivy Coast, so named because of the
uncontrollable growth of ivy in this area. The ivy runs down the shore and even
into the ocean. You feel the moist air coming off the ocean to the east. To the
west the Ivy Coast grows impenetrable, but it eases up to the south, where a
small lake can be seen. The ivy ends its growth to the southwest, as it meets up
with the emergence of the eastern swamps.

A large pelican is resting atop the ivy here. A fat worm dangles limply from its
beak.

>item "pelican"
That's not a verb I recognize.

>s

Lyndra Lake (1)
     You are on the banks of the legendary Lyndra Lake, named after a story
about two lovers that Idah once told you. The lake's beauty is overpowering. It
is very still, only disturbed as its same-named river empties into it. The Ivy
Coast begins north of here, and to the west tall gyal grass blows in the gentle
winds. You think you can make your way around the magnificent lake to the south.

>s

South of Lake
     Here you can see the Lyndra Lake's still waters through the small plants
and bushes that grow here. You can make your way north through the bushes, and a
steep incline leads northeast to a cliff above the lake. Fields of tall gyal
grass rustle in the wind to the northwest.

>ne

Lyndra Lake (2)
     This small cliff overlooks the legendary Lyndra Lake. Below you the gentle
lake lies calm, except for where the Lyndra River flows into it. You can see to
the north the Ivy Coast, though the dense growth of ivy makes the way
impassable. The hill descends to the southwest, and to the east you see the
rocky outcroppings of the Cliffs of Mydar as they skirt the coastline of the
Mydar Ocean.

>w
The only way down is to the southwest.

>e
The only way down is to the southwest.

>x lake
The Lyndra Lake is a majestic sight from here. It is named after a legend Idah
once told you about two star-crossed lovers who eventually met their end in the
swamp. The lake and river are some sort of blessing that was called about in
their honor.

>sw

South of Lake
     Here you can see the Lyndra Lake's still waters through the small plants
and bushes that grow here. You can make your way north through the bushes, and a
steep incline leads northeast to a cliff above the lake. Fields of tall gyal
grass rustle in the wind to the northwest.

>nw

Swampy Grasslands
     The reeds of gyal grass here are almost twice as tall as you. You push and
shove a path, but the grass just springs back up after you, making backtracking
impossible. The ground here is wet, and it seems to grow worse to the north. To
the east, southeast, and northeast you can hear the sound of water.

>n

Deep Swamp
     You are now dredging through waist-deep waters in the eastern swamp. Bugs
assault you, and you think you feel things against your legs. The mossy trees
hang low, blocking any sunlight from reaching this place of despair. You think
there is higher ground to the northwest, and to the south you see tall
grasslands.

>nw

Shallow Swamp
     You are trekking through the endless swamplands, trying to stay above the
now-boggy ground. Your way is filled with detours and sinking pits of quicksand
and bog mud. To the west the swamp lightens up, while to the southeast lies the
very heart of it. You can see the mossy trees and tall gyal grass beckoning you
to your doom. To the east lie endless mires, waiting patiently for their next
victim to attempt to navigate a path through them.

>w

West of Swamp
     You are directly west of the swamps near town. The ground here is muddy and
little grows here but gyal grass and jhaka bushes, making the landscape very

growing more wet and more dangerous. Off to the northeast, you think you hear

Mires
     You are lost in the deep mires of the eastern swamplands. You think you
might be near the ocean, but you can't see through the low fog. More than once
you've almost stepped into one of the deadly mires, only to notice it at the
last moment. The way out apparently lies somewhere to the west, but the fog
makes seeing that far impossible. You feel as though you're going around in
circles.

A strange feline creature sits atop a patch of dry land nearby. As you approach,
it addresses you:

            "I'm known as the Mire Cat, in tales of Olde.
             Answer my riddle and acquire my gold.
             But be ye forewarned: One must learn how I think,
             And the meanings of words must be stretched to the brink."

The Mire Cat pauses, then recites:

            "Lots of human beings ponder this thought.
             It is found within the center of each life.
             For an inquiry 'tis infinite yet simple,
             Except if questioned is a double-bladed knife."

The Mire Cat looks at you expectantly.

You begin to feel a bit hungry.

You decide that you should have something to eat before going on. Sitting down,
making yourself as comfortable as possible, you open your pack and eat your
fill.

(The pack is a little emptier now.)

Upon your return, the Mire Cat speaks:

             "So it seems you've returned with fresh resolution.
              I take it that you have discerned the solution?"

Again, the Mire Cat recites:

            "Lots of human beings ponder this thought.
             It is found within the center of each life.
             For an inquiry 'tis infinite yet simple,
