>l
Palace Gate

A tide of perambulators surges north along the crowded Broad Walk. Shaded glades
stretch away to the northeast, and a hint of color marks the western edge of the
Flower Walk.

>n
The east wind makes it difficult to walk straight.

Broad Walk

A brooding statue of Queen Victoria faces east, where the waters of the Round
Pond sparkle in the afternoon sun. Your eyes follow the crowded Broad Walk north
and south until its borders are lost amid the bustle of perambulators. Small
paths curve northeast and southeast, between the trees.

A cloud of pigeons fills the air! They circle overhead and congregate around a
nearby bench, where an aged woman is selling bags of crumbs.

"Feed the birds! Thirty p!" Her voice quavers with heartbreak.

>e
"Thirty p! Thirty p a bag!"

Round Pond

Ducks and swans bob on the sparkling surface of the Round Pond. They share the
water with an impressive fleet of toy boats, directed by the excited shouts of
children.

Crowded paths radiate from the Pond in many directions.

>se
A surge of offended nannies blocks your path.

>n
Inverness Terrace

Crowded walkways lead east and west along an iron fence. Narrow paths wander
south into the Gardens.

A young boy sits nearby, listening to a pair of headphones and idly blowing soap
bubbles. There's a dish full of soapy water by his side.

The boy dips the bubble wand in the dish and swishes it around.

>e
Lancaster Gate

A crooked old tree shades the perambulators as they roll south down the
Lancaster Walk. Shady paths lead west along an iron fence, and southwest between
the trees.

There's an old woman under the tree, struggling to open an umbrella. The stiff
east wind isn't making it easy for her.

>e
A surge of haughty nannies blocks your path.

>s
You begin to walk past the old woman, but stop in your tracks.

Her face is wrong.

You look a little closer and shudder to yourself. The entire left side of her
head is scarred with deep red lesions, twisting her oriental features into a
hideous mask. She must have been in an accident or something.

A strong gust of wind snatches the umbrella out of the old woman's hands and
sweeps it into the branches of the tree.

The woman circles the tree a few times, gazing helplessly upward. That umbrella
obviously means a lot to her, for a wistful tear is running down her cheek. But
nobody except you seems to notice her loss.

After a few moments, the old woman dries her eyes, gives the tree a vicious
little kick and shuffles away down the Lancaster Walk.

>s
Lancaster Walk

An impressive sculpture of a horse and rider dominates this bustling
intersection. The Walk continues north and south; lesser paths curve off in many
directions.

A broad field of grass, meticulously manicured, extends to the east. Beyond it
you can see the Long Water glittering between the trees.

A printed notice is stuck into the grass.

>s
Flower Walk

Gaily colored flower beds line the walks bending north and west, filling the air
with a gentle fragrance. A little path leads northwest, between the trees.

You can see a soccer ball half-hidden among the blossoms.

The spires of the Albert Memorial are all too visible to the south. Passing
tourists hoot with laughter at the dreadful sight; nannies hide their faces and
roll quickly away.

>s
You're already as close as anyone wants to get to the Albert Memorial.

>e
A surge of gawking tourists blocks your path.

One of the toy boats on the Round Pond catches your eye. The east wind blows it
closer, and you realize that the white sails are actually wings. It's a folded
paper bird, floating just within reach.

>s
The Wabe

This grassy clearing is only twenty feet across, and perfectly circular. Paths
wander off in many directions through the surrounding thicket.

A shaft of golden sunlight falls across a handsome antique sundial, erected at
the exact center of the clearing.

>w
The thicket blocks your path.

>sw
A noise makes you hesitate.

For a moment, nothing happens. Then the east wind puffs through the clearing,
and the gnomon on the sundial wobbles with a faint scrape.
