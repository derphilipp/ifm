=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<IFM> is a language for keeping track of your progress through an
Interactive Fiction game, and a program for producing various different
sorts of output using it.  You can record each room you visit and its
relation to other rooms, the initial locations of useful items you find,
and the tasks you need to perform in order to solve the game.

The B<IFM> mapping commands are designed so that you can easily add to the
map as you explore the game.  You type in the rooms you visit and the
directions you move in to reach other rooms, and B<IFM> calculates the
position of each room in relation to the others.  A map can consist of
several independent sections, allowing you to divide up the map however you
like.  See L<"MAKING MAPS"> for an example of how to make a map.

The B<IFM> task commands, if used, allow you to specify the order in which
game-solving tasks must be done.  The B<IFM> program can then calculate and
print a high-level 'walkthrough' of the game.  See L<"SOLVING THE GAME">
for examples of how to do this.

Several output formats are available, including PostScript and ASCII text
-- see L<"OUTPUT FORMATS">.  Some of the output formats have a set of
variables which control the appearance of the output -- see L<"OUTPUT
VARIABLES">.
