* There's a web page set up by Dave Chapeskie (dchapes@ddm.wox.org) which
  has IFM maps in source and PostScript format, at

      http://www.sentex.net/~dchapes/ifm

  At the moment it contains maps of a few Infocom and Inform games.  Some
  are complete, others not quite.  A few have tasks set up so that a
  walkthrough can be made.  The site hasn't been updated for a while.

* The :file:`demos` subdirectory of the IFM distribution contains some
  demonstration maps that don't give away secrets from real games.
