Another one is that if I have:
 task "do something" get item;
 item "something" given score 5;

The lister doesn't give me the 5 points.  Of course I can just move the
score option to the task but I think it would be nice if it worked in
either place.

I figured this one out eventually.

That would be a nice idea.  Although I now like the fact that I don't
have to specify the whole list of directions it's what made most sense
when I started.  I especially like being able to say just "ne" when the
real link is something like "ne n n n n".

Great!

Actually I was going to ask for this.  Will it print out each room that
is traversed even if no tasks are done in that room?

Hmm, actually a separate option that just adds the directions between
rooms might be nice, ie something like:

  Somewhere:
    do something

  Other place (n.u.e.out)
    do something else


In addition it would be nice to be able to have a task explicitly drop
some/all items.  For example in Curses when you read the poetry book it
gets left where you read it.  Since that task can be done anywhere it
would be nice to have IFM remember where the book is left so it can go
back and pick it up again if it is needed again.  The dropping of all
items is since some games have locations which can only be traversed
empty handed (the fireplaces in Curses and Christminster come to mind).

I think the tricky part of this would be knowing when to automatically
generate "Get" lines in the output.  Examples: in Curses the "read
poetry" task would have a goto clause so you can't pick up the book
until returning to whatever room you just left; also in curses you
drop everything before entering the fireplace, even if you later need
some items they shouldn't be automaticly picked until later; however
if the task just somehow makes you drop some of your possessions then
you may want to pick them up again right away.  The solution to this
might be just force people to use a goto clause. (ie the second example
above could be written 'task "drop all. enter fireplace" drop all goto
Fireplace").

Another thing that would be nice is a task that can be done many
times.  The above example of reading the poetry in Curses is an example.
Currently you need to repeat the task line exactly the number of times
it will be repeated (with a slightly different tag).  This would
probably be a pain in the butt to code though.

No problem, despite the impression my suggestions may leave, the current
version is more than usable and I'm merrily creating maps/walkthoughs
of all the games I'm playing.  Speaking of which do you want to start a
collection of *.ifm files for various games?  If you want I'll toss up
a simple IFM web page (I haven't noticed an existing one) and put all
the *.ifm files I make (currently 4 complete and 3 partial) and any I'm
sent there.  You could then perhaps mention this web page in the next
release.  Either that or ask Volker to create a directory on gmd.

Thanks, I'd be interested in beta testing this too.
