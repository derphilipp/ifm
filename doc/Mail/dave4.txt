attach images).

Hello again.  I have two more suggestions.  The first is easy.  I'd like
the "U/D" and "I/O" text to sometimes be "D/U" or "O/I".  For example:

room "A";
room "B" dir e go out;

should give:

    +---+         +---+
    |   |         |   |
    | A |-- O/I --| B |
    |   |         |   |
    +---+         +---+

(instead of I/O) to help indicate which way is out and which way is in.
Either that or go the more complicated route and do it more like the way
the old Infocom maps did it:

    +---+         +---+
    |   |       I |   |
    | A |---------| B |
    |   | O       |   |
    +---+         +---+


This next suggestion may be a big pain in the butt to implement put it
would still be nice. :-)

The idea is to allow links to specify "half length" directions.  What
syntax would make sense for this I don't know, for the purpose of the
following examples I'll just use "se/2" to mean half the length of "se".

I've come across several situation where this would help.  In these
examples I'll first show how I'm currently doing things followed by what
the "half distance" method would give.

# From Zork 1.  The relative location of these
# two rooms is fixed by other rooms/links.
room "N/S Passage";
room "Deep Canyon" dir ne s ne;

              +---+
              |   |
        /|    | D |
       / |    |   |
      /  |    /---+
     /   |   /
+---/    |  /
|   |    | /
| N |    |/
|   |
+---+

(By the way, this looks okay with splines in tkifm but quite weird
 in the Postscript output, try it and see).

With "half length" directions this could be written:
room "N/S Passage";
room "Deep Canyon" dir ne/2 e ne/2;
(again, use of the '/2' is just for the purpose of these examples)

              +---+
              |   |
              | D |
              |   |
              /---+
     /-------/
+---/
|   |
| N |
|   |
+---+ (.5n+.5e + 1e + .5n + .5e = 1n + 2e)

This looks much nicer.

Also, it would be nice to be able to place rooms offset from the normal
grid:

# From Planetfall
room "Mech. Corridor North" tag MechN;
room "Physical Plant" dir w sw;
room "Mech. Corridor" dir se e link MechN;

              +---+
              |   |
        /-----| N |
       /      |   |
      /       +---+
     /
+---+
|   |
| P |
|   |
+---+
     \
      \       +---+
       \      |   |
        \-----| M |
              |   |
              +---+

This is a bit annoying in that the structure occupies what a 3x3 grid of
rooms would.  With "half distances" this becomes:

room "Mech. Corridor North" tag MechN;
room "Physical Plant" dir w/2 sw/2;
room "Mech. Corridor" dir se/2 e/2 link MechN;

       +---+
       |   |
     /-| A |
+---+  |   |
|   |  +---+ (.5w + .5s+.5w = 1w+.5s)
| C |
|   |  +---+
+---+  |   |
     \-| B |
       |   |
       +---+

It would then look a little nicer but more importantly it would only
occupy what a 2x2 grid of rooms would.

So what do you think?  Is this desirable?  Is it doable?

I should really take a look at the code and see if I can help you out
and implement some of my suggestions.
