Mostly, I've been trying to figure out how to solve two problems:

1. The limited light source problem (eg Zork lantern)
2. The time limit problem (eg getting food in Planetfall)

They aren't unrelated, but the limited light source is more specific -- ie,
it could
be solved by making sure the light source was only turned on when it was
needed.
This has turned out to not be so easy. :)

The time limit problem can be kludged around by ordering tasks with 'after'
clauses,
but it's a hassle to find every loose item and say "after get_food" to make
sure the
task engine doesn't go on an inventory collecting pass and starve. :)

There's also carrying capacity, but that's addressed in the docs (by way of
saying
you're out of luck).  I think if you could specify "leave item" on tasks and
items as
well as rooms, links and joins you could pull some interesting stunts (I
mention this
since I'm cc-ing Glenn, bwa ha).

I'll go on a binge of reading what people have done on your page, Dave, and
hopefully I'll pick up some good tricks, but anyway, if you have any
insights on
the above, I'd be thrilled to hear them.  Eventually I'll just stop fooling
with old
Infocom games and get back to Christminster. :)

Glenn, if you're listening, great idea, great program, curse you for
creating a hole
into which I can sink my time. :)
