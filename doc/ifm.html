</A></H1>
<STRONG>IFM</STRONG> is a language for keeping track of your progress through an Interactive
Fiction game, and a program for producing various different sorts of output
using it. You can record each room you visit and its relation to other
rooms, the initial locations of useful items you find, and the tasks you
need to perform in order to solve the game.


<P>

The <STRONG>IFM</STRONG> mapping commands are designed so that you can easily add to the map as you
explore the game. You type in the rooms you visit and the directions you
move in to reach other rooms, and <STRONG>IFM</STRONG> calculates the position of each room in relation to the others. A map can
consist of several independent sections, allowing you to divide up the map
however you like. See <A HREF="#MAKING_MAPS">MAKING MAPS</A> for an example of how to make a map.


<P>

The <STRONG>IFM</STRONG> task commands, if used, allow you to specify the order in which
game-solving tasks must be done. The <STRONG>IFM</STRONG> program can then calculate and print a high-level 'walkthrough' of the
game. See <A HREF="#SOLVING_THE_GAME">SOLVING THE GAME</A>
for examples of how to do this.


<P>

Several output formats are available, including PostScript and ASCII text
-- see <A HREF="#OUTPUT_FORMATS">OUTPUT FORMATS</A>. Some of the output formats have a set of variables which control the
appearance of the output -- see <A HREF="#Output_Variables">Output Variables</A>.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="OPERATION">OPERATION

</A></H1>
On startup, <STRONG>IFM</STRONG> does the following. Firstly, the system initialization file is read. This
sets defaults used by everyone. This file is called
<EM>ifm-init.ifm</EM>, and is found by searching a standard set of directories. You can override
this search path by setting the environment variable
<STRONG>IFMPATH</STRONG> to be a colon-separated list of directories.


<P>

Then, if you have a personal initialization file, that is read. This file
is found in the directory specified by your <STRONG>HOME</STRONG> environment variable. On Unix systems it is called <EM>.ifmrc</EM>, and on Win32 systems it is called
<EM>ifm.ini</EM>. You can use this file to customize the default variable settings for
different types of output.


<P>

Then input from the <CODE>file(s)</CODE> on the command-line is read. If no
files were specified, <CODE>stdin</CODE> is read. A filename equal to <EM>-</EM> also indicates that
<CODE>stdin</CODE> should be read at that point.


<P>

If any of the <STRONG>-map</STRONG>, <STRONG>-items</STRONG>, <STRONG>-tasks</STRONG> or <STRONG>-show</STRONG> options was specified, the appropriate output is produced. If not, only a
syntax check of the input is done.


<P>

When producing output, the output format specified by the <STRONG>-format</STRONG> option is used. If this was not specified, the first format in the list
which supports this type of output is chosen.


<P>

Some of the output formats use additional library files to do their work.
For example, the PostScript output format adds a standard ``prolog'' file
to all output. These files are found using the same search path as the
system initialization file (see above).

The traditional Infocom-style way of drawing Interactive Fiction maps is
the 'boxes-and-lines' method. For example:


<P>

<PRE>    +--------------+   +--------------+   +--------------+
    |              |   |              |   |              |
    |    Kitchen   |---|    Lounge    |   |     Study    |
    |              |   |              |   |              |
    +--------------+   +--------------+   +--------------+
            |       \          |                  |
            |        \         |                  |
            |         \        |                  |
    +--------------+   +--------------+           |
    |              |   |              |           |
    |    Garage    |   |  Dining Room |-----------+
    |              |   |              |
    +--------------+   +--------------+
</PRE>

<P>

This is the style of map that <STRONG>IFM</STRONG> produces. Rooms are represented as boxes on a square grid, and links
between the rooms are drawn as lines connecting them. Links emanate from
rooms in any of the eight standard compass directions, and also follow the
grid.


<P>

In the following sections, we'll introduce the <STRONG>IFM</STRONG> commands used to draw the example map above.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Adding_Rooms">Adding Rooms

</A></H2>
To draw the example map from the previous section, you first choose an
arbitrary start location: the kitchen (when mapping a real game, you'd
choose your actual start location). To add the kitchen, just type this:


<P>

<PRE>    room &quot;Kitchen&quot;;
</PRE>

<P>

Now you're in the kitchen. Suppose, if this were a real game, that you
first went south to explore the garage. That can be added to the map like
this:


<P>

<PRE>    room &quot;Garage&quot; dir south;
</PRE>

<P>

Now you've said which way you went to get to the garage, and since you were
in the kitchen, <STRONG>IFM</STRONG> knows that the garage is south of the kitchen. By the way, 'south' can be
abbreviated 's' (and similarly for all other directions), just like in the
games.


<P>

Ok, you're in the garage. Unfortunately, that's a dead end and you have to
retrace your steps to the kitchen. You've already mapped that, so there's
no need to do anything. Now you head off east to the lounge. Now, you're
moving from the kitchen again but <STRONG>IFM</STRONG> thinks you're in the garage (<STRONG>IFM</STRONG>'s idea of 'where you are' is always the last room mentioned). You need a
way of referring to the kitchen again -- to do that, you add a 'tag' to it
by changing the 'kitchen' line like this:


<P>

<PRE>    room &quot;Kitchen&quot; tag Kitchen;
</PRE>

<P>

The tag name can be any name you like. You might think that you could refer
to the kitchen by using the name in quotes, but that would mean you could
never have two distinct rooms with the same name. Another advantage of tags
is that they can be much shorter than the real room names. The tag 'K'
would be just as valid in the example above (though not as readable).


<P>

Now you can refer to the kitchen by its tag, so you can move east from it
into the lounge like this:


<P>

<PRE>    room &quot;Lounge&quot; dir e from Kitchen;
</PRE>

<P>

The 'from' clause tells <STRONG>IFM</STRONG> where you're moving from. If it's omitted, it assumes you're moving from
the last room mentioned.


<P>

Continuing your exploration, you move south into the dining room:


<P>

<PRE>    room &quot;Dining Room&quot; dir s;
</PRE>

<P>

You exit the dining room to the east, and turn a corner north before
entering the study. How can you represent the corner faithfully on the map?
Like this:


<P>

<PRE>    room &quot;Study&quot; dir e n;
</PRE>

<P>

This says that you move east, then north, to get to the study. Now, what if
someone locked the study door behind you and the only way out was through
the window? That's a one-way trip into the study, which you can indicate
using the 'oneway' attribute like this:


<P>

<PRE>    room &quot;Study&quot; dir e n oneway;
</PRE>

<P>

This is indicated on the map by an arrow.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Adding_Links">Adding Links

</A></H2>
The map as it stands is not complete -- the diagonal link between the
kitchen and the dining room is missing (because you didn't go that way in
visiting the kitchen or the dining room). To add it, you need to modify the
dining room command like this:


<P>

<PRE>    room &quot;Dining Room&quot; dir s link Kitchen;
</PRE>

<P>

The 'link' clause creates a straight-line link between the current room and
the room with the specified tag name (in this case, the kitchen).


<P>

Note that if this link needed to turn corners, as in the study example
above, then that method of linking the rooms wouldn't have worked. In that
case, you'd have to use the stand-alone 'link' command. For example:


<P>

<PRE>    link Diner to Kitchen dir n nw;
</PRE>

<P>

This assumes you've given the dining room the tag name 'Diner'. The link
starts off going north, then turns northwest, and finally goes toward the
kitchen. Note that in a 'link' command, if you omit the final direction
which leads to the linked room, it is added automatically.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Other_Directions">Other Directions

</A></H2>
Suppose that there were steps down from the kitchen into the garage, and
that you wanted to indicate that you could up or down as well. You could do
that using the 'go' clause, like this:


<P>

<PRE>    room &quot;Garage&quot; dir s go down;
</PRE>

<P>

This indicates that the actual direction travelled is downwards, but it is
still represented as south on the map. The 'go' clause accepts 'up',
'down', 'in' and 'out'. As with compass directions, 'up' and 'down' may be
abbreviated as 'u' and 'd'.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Room_Exits">Room Exits

</A></H2>
At various points in a game, you arrive in a room with many directions to
explore. It is useful to be able to mark some of these directions as
unexplored, so that you can come back and explore them later. You could
mark these by creating dummy rooms in those directions, but this is
tedious. Alternatively, you can use the 'exit' clause, like this:


<P>

<PRE>    room &quot;Dining Room&quot; dir s exit nw e;
</PRE>

<P>

This says that there are two unexplored exits from this room, in the
northwest and east directions. When a map is drawn, this fact will be
displayed by a small line poking out of the room in those directions.


<P>

When you come to actually explore those directions, and add links to new
rooms, the corresponding room exit markers will no longer be drawn. So you
can leave the exit clauses in if you want.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Map_Sections">Map Sections

</A></H2>
In <STRONG>IFM</STRONG>, rooms are divided into groups called 'map sections'. Each room in a map
section has an explicit spatial relationship to all the other rooms in that
section. A room which is obtained by moving via a 'dir' clause from a
previous room is on the same map section as the previous room, since its
co-ordinates can be calculated relative to it.


<P>

There are several reasons why it might be a good idea to split a game map
into different sections:


<P>

<UL>
<LI><STRONG></STRONG>
Some maps can be very large, and may not look good on a single piece of
paper.


<P>

<LI><STRONG></STRONG>
It might be awkward to put rooms in relation to each other because of, say,
a lot of up/down connections which have to be 'flattened out'.


<P>

<LI><STRONG></STRONG>
The game might naturally divide into sections -- a prologue, middle-game
and end-game, for example.


<P>

</UL>
<STRONG>IFM</STRONG> manages independent map sections automatically, by deciding which rooms are
on which section. No special command is needed to start a new map section
-- simply define a room which has no connection to any previous room, by
leaving out the 'dir' clause (note that that's how the kitchen starts out,
in the example).


<P>

Rooms on different map sections are completely separate, and you may not
link them via the 'link' command. However, you can indicate where a room on
one section is connected to a room on another, using the 'join' command:


<P>

<PRE>    join Room1 to Room2;
</PRE>

<P>

As usual, 'Room1' and 'Room2' are tag names. You can also use 'join' as a
clause in a room command (usually done with the room starting in a new
section):


<P>

<PRE>    room &quot;Basement&quot; join Ground_Floor;
</PRE>

<P>

The 'joined' status of the two rooms is indicated on the map, the exact
manner depending on the output format.


<P>

Each map section can be given a title using the 'map' command, like this:


<P>

<PRE>    map &quot;Kensington Gardens&quot;;
</PRE>

<P>

This names the next map section that hasn't been named. Note that you
should have as many 'map' commands as you have map sections, although this
isn't enforced -- any names that are missing will be assigned default
names, and extra names will be ignored. It's conventional to give a 'map'
command just before starting a new map section.


<P>

In rare circumstances (e.g. a three-dimensional maze) you may need to have
rooms on the same map section which are not connected to each other. The
room 'dir' clause creates an implicit link from the previous room by
default, but you can stop this from happening by using the 'nolink'
attribute. As a trivial example:


<P>

<PRE>    room &quot;One Side of Wall&quot; tag this_side;
    room &quot;Other Side of Wall&quot; dir e nolink tag other_side;
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    room &quot;Underground Passage&quot; tag passage_1;
    room &quot;Underground Passage&quot; tag passage_2 dir e;
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    join this_side to passage_1 go down;
    join passage_2 to other_side go up;
</PRE>

<P>

In this example, there are two map sections: above ground, and below
ground. But the two above-ground rooms are not connected directly.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Adding_Items">Adding Items

</A></H2>
As well as rooms, <STRONG>IFM</STRONG> can indicate the initial rooms of various items found in the game. To add
an item, use the 'item' command like this:


<P>

<PRE>    item &quot;Spoon&quot; in Kitchen;
</PRE>

<P>

The 'in' clause can be omitted, and then the room defaults to the last room
mentioned. You can also add an arbitrary note to each item (e.g. to remind
you what it's for) using the 'note' attribute:


<P>

<PRE>    item &quot;Spoon&quot; in Kitchen note &quot;Stirs tea&quot;;
</PRE>

<P>

Here's the completed map description for the above example, with a few
other items thrown in:


<P>

<PRE>    # Example map.
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    room &quot;Kitchen&quot; tag Kitchen;
    item &quot;spoon&quot; note &quot;Stirs tea&quot;;
    item &quot;sink&quot;;
    item &quot;monkey&quot;;
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    room &quot;Garage&quot; dir s go down;
    item &quot;monkey wrench&quot; note &quot;For wrenching monkey out of sink&quot;;
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    room &quot;Lounge&quot; dir e from Kitchen;
    item &quot;TV set&quot;;
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    room &quot;Dining Room&quot; dir s link Kitchen;
    item &quot;table&quot;;
    item &quot;chair&quot;;
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    room &quot;Study&quot; dir e n oneway;
</PRE>

<P>

See <A HREF="#Map_Output">Map Output</A> for how to display it.

<H2><A NAME="Conflicts">Conflicts

</A></H2>
After creating a map from a real game and sending the results through
<STRONG>IFM</STRONG>, you may get warnings which talk about things overlapping. This is due to
two rooms, or a room and a link, wanting to occupy the same space on the
map. There are several ways that this could occur:


<P>

<UL>
<LI><STRONG></STRONG>
The game designer made some room links longer than others, and you haven't
taken that into account. To extend the length of a link, just add a length
indicator after the direction in the 'dir' clause (e.g. 'dir e 2' instead
of 'dir e').


<P>

<LI><STRONG></STRONG>
One of the links turned a corner, so that the direction you use to go back
isn't the opposite of the one you used to get here. In that case, you need
to add the corner-turn in the link (e.g. 'dir e s' instead of 'dir e').


<P>

<LI><STRONG></STRONG>
The map is multi-level, in which case it's probably best to split it into
different map sections.


<P>

<LI><STRONG></STRONG>
The map is just weird. Colossal Cave is a good example, particularly the
above-ground section and the mazes. There seems to be no logic tying the
rooms together. You're on your own.


<P>

</UL>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="SOLVING_THE_GAME">SOLVING THE GAME

</A></H1>
As well as making a map of your game, <STRONG>IFM</STRONG> can be used to record the steps you took to solve it. The <STRONG>IFM</STRONG> program can then calculate a (fairly) optimal solution. This section is a
guide to how to do it. Again, it's not a complete specification -- see <A HREF="#LANGUAGE">LANGUAGE</A> for that.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Introduction_to_Tasks">Introduction to Tasks

</A></H2>
The basic game-solving action is called a <STRONG>task</STRONG> in <STRONG>IFM</STRONG>-speak. To introduce a task, you use the 'task' command, like this:


<P>

<PRE>    task &quot;Put the fluffy bunny in the incinerator&quot;;
</PRE>

<P>

Most tasks need to be done in a certain room. The default is that a task
must be done in the last room mentioned. You can change that by using the
'in' clause, just as for items. Some tasks can be done anywhere -- you can
say 'in any' to indicate that. As usual, you can add tags to tasks in order
to refer to them later.


<P>

The game solver in <STRONG>IFM</STRONG> divides tasks into two fundamental types: 'safe' and 'unsafe'. An unsafe
task is one that, if done, might get you into a position where solving the
game is impossible. The game solver avoids doing unsafe tasks until it
really has to.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Requiring_Tasks">Requiring Tasks

</A></H2>
A lot of tasks require a previous task to be done first. To say this, you
use the 'after' clause:


<P>

<PRE>    task &quot;Press incinerator start switch&quot; tag press_switch;
    ...
    task &quot;Put the fluffy bunny in the incinerator&quot; after press_switch;
</PRE>

<P>

As a shortcut, to avoid having to tag many tasks, you can say 'after last'
to indicate the last task mentioned. For example, if the two tasks above
could be done in the same room, you could say


<P>

<PRE>    task &quot;Press incinerator start switch&quot; tag press_switch;
    task &quot;Put the fluffy bunny in the incinerator&quot; after last;
</PRE>

<P>

Alternatively, you could merge the two into a single task -- the simplicity
or complexity of tasks is up to you.


<P>

The 'after' clause only says that a task will come after another -- it
doesn't specify how soon after. But in some situations it is essential that
a task immediately follows a specific previous task, without deviation. You
can use the task 'follow' clause to specify this. For example:


<P>

<PRE>    room &quot;Mission Control&quot; ...;
    task &quot;Activate launch sequence&quot; tag activate;
    ...
    room &quot;Rocket Cabin&quot; ...;
    task &quot;Fasten seat belt&quot; follow activate;
</PRE>

<P>

The 'follow' clause creates a chain of tasks that must be done one after
the other. The game solver will not attempt the first task in the chain
until it knows that all the tasks are possible (i.e. all the prerequisites
for each task in the chain are satisfied). Also, if one of the tasks in the
chain is unsafe, then all previous tasks in the chain are also marked
unsafe.


<P>

Of course, you can only have a single task in a 'follow' clause -- the
immediately preceding task. It is an error for two or more tasks to try to
immediately follow the same task.

<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Requiring_Items">Requiring Items

</A></H2>
For a lot of tasks, you need to have one or more items in your possession.
You can indicate this by using the 'need' clause, like this:


<P>

<PRE>    task &quot;Put the fluffy bunny in the incinerator&quot; need bunny;
</PRE>

<P>

Here, 'bunny' is the tag name of the corresponding item. You can list more
than one item tag -- e.g. 'need bunny asbestos_gloves'.


<P>

Note that you don't need to add tasks to get required items yourself -- the
game solver does that automatically. It knows it has to get all the items
which appear in 'need' clauses.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Obtaining_Items">Obtaining Items

</A></H2>
Some tasks need to be done before you can get an item. One way to indicate
this is with the task 'get' clause:


<P>

<PRE>    task &quot;Put money in drinks machine&quot; need coin get lemonade;
</PRE>

<P>

This naturally implies that all tasks which supply an item (via the 'get'
clause) must be done before any task which needs that item.


<P>

An alternate way to phrase this is with the item 'after' clause, which says
that the item can't be picked up until a specified task is done. This is a
common combination in <STRONG>IFM</STRONG>:


<P>

<PRE>    task &quot;Put money in drinks machine&quot; need coin;
    item &quot;lemonade&quot; hidden after last;
</PRE>

<P>

Some items are only available <EM>before</EM> doing a certain task. You can use the 'before' clause to say that:


<P>

<PRE>    item &quot;precious diamond&quot; before trigger_alarm;
</PRE>

<P>

Some items can only be picked up if you're already carrying another -- use
the 'need' clause for that:


<P>

<PRE>    item &quot;hot coal&quot; need tongs;
</PRE>

<P>

Sometimes, doing a task not only allows you to get an item, but also puts
it in your inventory. You can say that using the 'give' clause:


<P>

<PRE>    task &quot;Buy beer&quot; need money give beer_mug;
</PRE>

<P>

Note that 'give' overrides all other restrictions placed on getting items.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Losing_Items">Losing Items

</A></H2>
Some tasks cause items to be destroyed. You can say that with the 'lose'
clause:


<P>

<PRE>    task &quot;Light bonfire&quot; need match lose match;
</PRE>

<P>

This naturally implies that all other tasks which need the item must be
done before the task that destroys it. A 'drop' task is never generated for
items that are lost in this way.


<P>

Incidentally, you can use the special tag 'it' to refer to the last room,
item or task tag name within a command. So the previous example could also
have been written


<P>

<PRE>    task &quot;Light bonfire&quot; need match lose it;
</PRE>

<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Dropping_Items">Dropping Items

</A></H2>
Normally, you don't have to add explicit drop-item tasks -- <STRONG>IFM</STRONG> knows when an item is no longer useful, and drops it automatically. But
sometimes items need to be dropped only temporarily. You can do that using
the 'drop' clause:


<P>

<PRE>    task &quot;Throw spear at tree stump&quot; need spear drop it tag target_practice;
</PRE>

<P>

In this example, the spear is dropped in the same room that the task was
done in. If you ever need the spear for anything else, it will be picked up
by the game solver. Note that an item will only be dropped if it is being
carried -- mentioning an item in a 'drop' clause does not imply that it's
needed to do the task.


<P>

Sometimes items must be dropped in a different room to the one you're in.
You can use the 'in' clause to modify things:


<P>

<PRE>    room &quot;Top of Chute&quot;;
    task &quot;Put laundry in chute&quot; need laundry drop it in Bottom_of_Chute;
</PRE>

<P>

In other cases, you need to drop all the items you're carrying, or all
except certain items. You can use 'drop all' and 'drop all except' to say
that.


<P>

Normally, if an item is dropped but is needed again for some other task,
there is nothing to stop the game solver picking it up again (provided
there's a path to the room the item was dropped in). But sometimes you need
to drop an item and not pick it up again until you've done something else.
You can use the 'until' clause to say that:


<P>

<PRE>    task &quot;Put coin in slot&quot; give chocolate drop coin until open_machine;
</PRE>

<P>

A task which drops items will be marked unsafe if there is no path back to
the dropped items.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Leaving_Items">Leaving Items

</A></H2>
There are some situations where your movement is blocked if you are
carrying particular items. You can use the 'leave' attribute of rooms,
links and joins to specify a list of items that must be left behind before
using them. For example:


<P>

<PRE>    room &quot;Bottom of Canyon&quot;;
    item &quot;heavy boulder&quot; tag boulder;
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    room &quot;Top of Canyon&quot; dir n go up leave boulder;
</PRE>

<P>

If the 'leave' clause appears before the 'dir' clause, that means the items
must be dropped before entering the room (from any direction). It is
generally the case that, if an attribute could apply to a room or its
implicit link with the previous one, its position relative to the 'dir'
clause is what decides it.


<P>

You can also say 'leave all', which means that you must leave all the items
you're currently carrying, and 'leave all except', which omits certain
items from being left behind.


<P>

When finding a solution, the game solver will carry items until it is
forced to drop them. If the dropped items are needed later, the game solver
will try to come back and get them. If it is trying to do a task which
requires items, it will choose a route to get to the task room which
doesn't involve dropping any of the needed items.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Limiting_Movement">Limiting Movement

</A></H2>
Sometimes an item is required, or a task needs to be done, before movement
in a certain direction is possible. To represent this, you can give 'need'
and 'after' clauses to rooms, links and joins. For example:


<P>

<PRE>    ...
    room &quot;Cemetery&quot; dir s from winding_path;
    task &quot;Unlock the iron door&quot; need rusty_key;
    room &quot;Crypt&quot; dir s go down after last;
    ...
</PRE>

<P>

Here's another example:


<P>

<PRE>    ...
    room &quot;Dimly-lit Passage&quot; dir e;
    room &quot;Dark Passage&quot; dir e need candle;
    ...
</PRE>

<P>

In this case it is the link between the two rooms that is blocked off until
the candle is obtained. If the 'dir' clause had appeared before the 'need'
clause, the restriction would apply to the room itself (i.e. no entering
the room from <EM>any</EM> direction without the candle).


<P>

In some cases, doing a task closes off a room, link or join so that it
can't be used any more. You can use the 'before' clause to indicate this:


<P>

<PRE>    room &quot;Bank Vault&quot; tag Vault;
    room &quot;Bank Entrance&quot; tag Entrance dir e before trigger_alarm;
</PRE>

<P>

All tasks which close things off like this are marked unsafe, since they
could block off a crucial path through the game.


<P>

Sometimes in a game there is the situation where a path is closed off and,
later on in the game, reopened again. A single link or join can't represent
this. However, there's nothing to stop you from using two or more joins
between the same rooms. If you mark them with the 'hidden' attribute, they
won't appear on the map either. For example, this line could be added to
the previous example to provide an escape route:


<P>

<PRE>    join Vault to Entrance go e after disable_alarm hidden;
</PRE>

<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Movement_Tasks">Movement Tasks

</A></H2>
There are several different ways of moving around in a game. The usual way
is to say the direction you want to go in. Another way is to do something
else which results in movement. A good example is the magic word <STRONG>XYZZY</STRONG>
from Colossal Cave. It acts exactly like a movement command, in that you
can use it again and again and it moves you somewhere predictable. The best
way to represent this in <STRONG>IFM</STRONG> is to use a join to connect the two rooms, and specify the command used to
do the movement via the 'cmd' clause, like this:


<P>

<PRE>    join Debris_Room to Building after examine_wall cmd &quot;XYZZY&quot;;
</PRE>

<P>

Yet another way of moving around is a one-off event that 'teleports' you to
a different room. You can indicate that this happens using the task 'goto'
clause, and supplying the tag name of the destination room. For example:


<P>

<PRE>    task &quot;Get captured by goblins&quot; goto Dungeon;
</PRE>

<P>

As soon as the task is done, you 'teleport' to the new location -- no
intervening rooms are visited. Note that because each task is only done
once, this method of travel can only be used once. Note also that the
'drop' and 'leave' actions are done <EM>before</EM> teleporting you to the new location (so if you drop items in the 'current
room', you will be teleported away from the dropped items).


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Scoring_Points">Scoring Points

</A></H2>
Many games have some sort of scoring system, whereby you get points for
doing various things. In <STRONG>IFM</STRONG> you can record this using the 'score &lt;integer&gt;' clause, which can
apply to rooms, items or tasks. For rooms, it's the score you get when
visiting it for the first time. For items, it's the score for first picking
it up. For tasks, it's the score for doing that task.


<P>

If an item has a score, but is given to the player via a task 'give'
clause, then its score is added to the score for that task instead. If an
item has a score and also has the (obsolete) 'given' attribute, the score
won't be registered at all. So don't use 'given' -- use the task 'give'
clause instead.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Finishing_the_Game">Finishing the Game

</A></H2>
Usually a game finishes when you complete some final task. You can indicate
which task this is using the 'finish' attribute. This attribute can attach
to rooms, items or tasks, giving three different types of finish condition:
entering a room, picking up an object or doing a task. If the game solver
ever manages to do something which is flagged with the 'finish' attribute,
it considers the game solved and stops. Any extra things left to do will
not be done, even if they score points.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Finding_a_Solution">Finding a Solution

</A></H2>
Here's what the game solver does in order to come up with a solution to the
game. First, extra internal tasks are generated. These are tasks to (a) get
items which are scored, (b) get items which are required for
explicitly-mentioned tasks to be done, (c) get items which are needed to go
in certain directions, and (d) go to rooms which are scored.


<P>

Next, all the rooms are connected using their links and joins. This means
that for each room, a list is made of all other rooms reachable in one
move. Note that it is possible for some rooms to be unreachable -- for
example, all rooms in a section where there is no 'join' to rooms on other
sections.


<P>

Then the task dependencies are calculated. A dependency is where one task
must be done before another. The task dependencies are examined to see if
there are any cycles -- that is, chains of tasks where each one must be
done before the next, and the last must be done before the first. If there
are any, then the game is unsolvable, since none of the tasks in a cycle
can be done.


<P>

If there are no cyclic dependencies, the task list is 'traversed' to find a
sequence which solves the game while satisfying the task dependencies. The
start room is the room which was first mentioned in the input (but this can
be changed -- see <A HREF="#LANGUAGE">LANGUAGE</A>). While there are tasks left in the task list, the following steps are
performed:


<P>

<OL>
<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_">

</A></STRONG>
The map is traversed to find the distances of all rooms from the current
room. Then the task list is sorted in order of ascending distance of the
rooms they must be done in. Tasks which can be done in any room count as
having distance zero.


<P>

<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_">

</A></STRONG>
Scan the sorted task list to find the nearest possible task. For a task to
be possible, the player must (a) have all required items, (b) have done all
required previous tasks, and (c) be able to get from the current room to
the task room via a path which doesn't require items not yet collected, or
tasks not yet done, or which involves dropping needed items on the way.


<P>

Priority is given to safe tasks. For a task to be safe, it must (a) not
have previously been marked unsafe (e.g. because it closes off map
connections) and (b) there must be a return path from the task room back to
the current one. The second condition is to avoid taking a one-way trip
before preparing properly.


<P>

If there are any safe tasks, the nearest one will be done next regardless
of how close an unsafe task is. If there are no safe task, the nearest
unsafe task will be chosen.


<P>

<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_">

</A></STRONG>
If there was a possible task, do it and remove it from the list. Move to
the room the task was done in (if any). If not, then the game is
unsolvable. Give up.


<P>

</OL>
The game solver automatically keeps track of which items the player is
carrying, and knows when an item will no longer be needed -- that's when
all tasks requiring that item have been done. When that happens, a 'drop'
task for the item is done. An exception is items which are needed to move
in a certain direction (see the last example above). In that case the item
is never dropped, since the game solver can't rule out having to go that
way again.


<P>

Some items, although they have no direct game-solving function, need to be
carried throughout the game -- e.g. some sort of container for carrying
other things. You can mark such items with the 'keep' attribute -- then
they will never be dropped.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Tweaking_the_Solution">Tweaking the Solution

</A></H2>
There will be some situations (quite a few, actually) where the game solver
doesn't do things the way you want it to. This section gives a few tips,
and some new keywords, for modifying things.


<P>

<STRONG>Making things safe</STRONG>




<P>

Firstly, the game solver is completely paranoid. It has to be, because it
doesn't do any lookahead past the current task. It won't do anything unsafe
(e.g. go to a room to do a task when there's no immediate return journey)
unless there's nothing safe left to do. It will quite happily plod halfway
across the map to pick something up rather than do something a bit scary in
the next room.


<P>

However, you can reassure it with the task 'safe' attribute. Adding this to
a task tells the solver that this task is safe, regardless of what it
thinks. So if you <EM>know</EM> that a one-way trip can eventually be returned from, by doing other tasks,
you can stop the solver from avoiding it. But bear in mind that by doing
this you are taking full responsibility if the solver gets stuck.


<P>

<STRONG>Changing path lengths</STRONG>




<P>

Another thing the solver doesn't know about is how easy or difficult it is
to get from place to place on the map. Suppose you're in a game which is on
two levels separated by a tiresome set of access doors with ID cards. The
connection between the levels may only be two rooms on the map, but it's a
lot more in terms of typing. You can avoid unnecessary trips through these
doors by artificially changing the 'length' of the connection between
levels, by using the 'length' attribute of links and joins:


<P>

<PRE>    room &quot;Level A&quot; tag LA ...;
    room &quot;Level B&quot; tag LB dir e length 50;
</PRE>

<P>

In this way, by choosing an appropriate number for the length, you make it
appear to the solver that all the rooms in level A are closer to each other
than any of the rooms in level B. This means that priority will be given to
tasks in rooms in the same level as you are now, (hopefully) minimizing the
number of level changes. Note that the 'length' attribute doesn't affect
map drawing at all.


<P>

<STRONG>Closing off paths</STRONG>




<P>

There may be times when you want a map connection to appear on the map, but
not be used in solving the game -- for example, it may be certain death to
go that way. You can use the 'nopath' attribute of rooms, links and joins
to indicate this. It doesn't affect map output in any way.


<P>

Another use for this attribute is to force the game solver to do things in
a different order. This might be preferable to adding fake task
dependencies.


<P>

<STRONG>Keeping fixes together</STRONG>




<P>

It's probably best to keep all your 'game tweaks' together, separate from
the 'pure' game, and commented appropriately. You can do this by using
commands which just modify existing objects, instead of creating new ones,
by referring to their tags. As an example, suppose you have the following
situation:


<P>

<PRE>    room &quot;Top of Chute&quot; ...;
    room &quot;Bottom of Chute&quot; dir s go down oneway;
    task &quot;Do something weird&quot; tag weird_task;
    ...
</PRE>

<P>

Suppose you're at the top of the chute, and that there's some stuff to be
done at the bottom, but no immediate way back up. As usual, the game solver
balks at taking a one-way trip and will do anything to avoid it. But
suppose you know that, as long as you have your giant inflatable
cheeseburger, you can get back out again. You can say:


<P>

<PRE>    # Bottom of chute isn't that scary.
    task weird_task need burger safe;
</PRE>

<P>

which modifies the task at the bottom of the chute to (a) require the
burger (so that you won't go down there without it), and (b) be considered
safe by the game solver. So it will happily slide down the chute without
getting stuck at the bottom.


<P>

This way of modifying previous objects applies all types of object, even
links and joins -- these can be tagged too, in the normal way. The single
exception is the implicit link created by the room 'dir' clause. These
links automatically get tagged when the room does, and with the same name.
So the two-level example above could be split into:


<P>

<PRE>    room &quot;Level A&quot; tag LA ...;
    room &quot;Level B&quot; tag LB dir e;
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    ...
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    # Stop gratuitous travel between levels.
    link LB length 50;
</PRE>

<P>

<STRONG>Debugging</STRONG>




<P>

Finally... you can gain an insight into what the game solver's up to by
using the <STRONG>-debug</STRONG> command-line option. This produces reams of output giving details of the
game solver's thoughts before it does anything. It's supposed to be
self-explanatory, but my view is slightly biased. Detailed documentation
may follow (a) if enough people ask for it, and (b) when I get around to
it.

<H2><A NAME="Limitations">Limitations

</A></H2>
Given the wild imaginations of today's IF authors, there are bound to be
some game solving situations that can't easily be dealt with using <STRONG>IFM</STRONG>. Some of the things that <STRONG>IFM</STRONG> ignores are:


<P>

<UL>
<LI><STRONG></STRONG>
Random events. For example, the Carousel room in Zork, and all the NPCs in
Colossal Cave. There's no way to address this problem, but then again,
hand-written walkthroughs have the same difficulty. However, if you're
trying to tailor recording output so that it will play back properly in an
interpreter, there is a workaround -- see <A HREF="#Task_List_Output">Task List Output</A>.


<P>

<LI><STRONG></STRONG>
Carrying capacity. A solution may require you to carry more than you're
allowed. This might be addressed in a future version, but
inventory-juggling puzzles are out of fashion these days (if they were ever
in) so this is not much of a problem. Some games provide you with an item
that can carry stuff for you -- if so, a workaround is to add some special
tasks that periodically put everything you're carrying into it.


<P>

</UL>
There are some other limitations that are the result of certain keyword
combinations in the current implementation of <STRONG>IFM</STRONG>. These are fixable, and hopefully will be in a later version. They are:


<P>

<UL>
<LI><STRONG></STRONG>
If you have more than one link or join which connects the same two rooms,
then if any of them set the 'length' attribute, they must <EM>all</EM> set it -- and to the same value. Otherwise <STRONG>IFM</STRONG> will give an error.


<P>

<LI><STRONG></STRONG>
Unsafe tasks in a 'follow' task chain normally cause all the previous tasks
in the chain to be marked unsafe too (so the solver will avoid trying the
first, knowing it'll be forced to do something distasteful later). However,
some tasks are not known to be unsafe until just before they might be done
-- specifically, those for which there is no return path. This is because
whether there's a return path depends on where you are now. So a 'follow'
chain could possibly lead to a game-solving dead end.


<P>

<LI><STRONG></STRONG>
There's a problem with the 'leave'/'need' attribute combination. The game
solver could select a path from one room to another in which an item must
be left behind at one point, but is needed for movement later on in the
path. This sort of path should be invalid, but isn't.

Maps are drawn in the classic Infocom style. Rooms are drawn as boxes, and
links as are drawn as lines (oneway with an arrow). Joins are marked by
adding a 'join number' to the room text of the joined rooms. Non-hidden
items can be shown in their initial rooms.

depending on whichever gives the best fit. Fonts of room and item text are
scaled to fit them in the room boxes, if required.


<P>

To view the PostScript file on-screen, you'll need a PostScript previewer.
I recommend Ghostview, which is free and is available for most systems.
This can also print the map on your printer, even if the printer doesn't
normally print PostScript files.

<STRONG>tkifm</STRONG> does that internally to build its map pictures. But you can control its
display by setting variables in the usual way.

</A></STRONG><DD>
This output produces a list of commands suitable for feeding to IF
interpreters in playback mode. All the commands in the output are converted
to uppercase.


<P>

In order for this to work properly, you have to give commands that the game
will understand. The 'cmd' attribute of rooms, links, joins and tasks can
help with this. Currently there's no item 'cmd' attribute, so you have to
make sure that the item description is recognized by the game (for get and
drop commands). Also, if a task is implicitly done in the game without you
having to type any commands (e.g. visiting a room), you can indicate this
by using 'cmd none'.


<P>

Of course, a recording will only play back properly in an interpreter if it
provides correct game commands. Random events can't be dealt with by
<STRONG>IFM</STRONG>, and will probably cause playback to fail. But you can work around this
with an interpreter that is able to fix the random seed at startup (e.g. <STRONG>dumb-frotz</STRONG>). This should eliminate most (but not all) of the problems of randomness.

<H2><A NAME="Customization">Customization

</A></H2>
You can change the appearance of many map features according to your taste.
You do this by setting the values of the variables that control those
features. This section tells you how to use variables -- for a complete
list of the customization variables available, see <A HREF="#Output_Variables">Output Variables</A>.


<P>

As a first example, the background colour of rooms is determined by the
variable 'room_colour'. Its default value is ``white''. It can be changed
like this:


<P>

<PRE>    room_colour = &quot;beige&quot;;
</PRE>

<P>

Setting a variable like this will affect all output formats. But in some
cases you don't want to do that. A good example is the one above -- if you
don't have a colour printer, you may not want to have beige rooms printed
(they'll come out greyish). To get around that, you can set variables that
are specific to a particular output format:


<P>

<PRE>    tk room_colour = &quot;beige&quot;;
</PRE>

<P>

This says to set the variable to ``beige'' only if producing Tk output. The
default for all other formats is still ``white''.


<P>

You can also customize the appearance of individual rooms and links on the
map, by using different display styles. A display style is just a group of
variable settings with a given name. For example, suppose you're making a
map of Colossal Cave and want to mark rooms where you can refill your water
bottle. You can define a style called, say, Water, like this:


<P>

<PRE>    style Water;
    room_colour = &quot;light blue&quot;;
    endstyle;
</PRE>

<P>

The values of variables that are set between the 'style' and 'endstyle'
clauses only apply to things drawn in that style. Now, if you declare rooms
like this:


<P>

<PRE>    room &quot;At End Of Road&quot;;
    room &quot;Inside Building&quot; style Water dir e go in;
</PRE>

<P>

then the room ``Inside Building'' will be drawn with a light blue
background. You can customize individual links in a similar manner. Note
that here you must put the 'style' clause before the 'dir' clause, so that
the style applies to the room. If it appeared afterwards, it would apply to
the implicit link to the previous room instead.


<P>

An alternative way to define a variable in a particular style is to use the
'in style' clause, like this:


<P>

<PRE>    room_colour = &quot;light blue&quot; in style Water;
</PRE>

<P>

If a style only changes a single variable, this may be more convenient.


<P>

If you assign a style (say, called <STRONG>newstyle</STRONG>) to an object, but don't define it anywhere in your input, then <STRONG>IFM</STRONG> will look for a file called
<EM>newstyle.ifm</EM> using the standard search path. If the file exists, it is expected to
define style <STRONG>newstyle</STRONG>. For example, you could put the ``Water'' style definition above into a
file called <EM>Water.ifm</EM> somewhere on the <STRONG>IFM</STRONG> search path, and it would be read automatically. This is useful if, for
example, you want to use the same style in several different maps.

There are many variables available for customizing output. At the moment,
only map output can be customized.


<P>

The names, descriptions and default values of the customization variables
are all contained in the <STRONG>IFM</STRONG> initialization file. You can change this file to set global defaults for
everybody, or alternatively set your own preferences in your personal init
file.


<P>

Here's the original initialization file that came bundled with <STRONG>IFM</STRONG>.

Previous versions of <STRONG>IFM</STRONG> had two object attributes which are now implemented as display styles: the
room 'puzzle' attribute, and the link 'special' attribute. Here's the
'puzzle' style:


<P>

<PRE>    # Room 'puzzle' style (was previously the 'puzzle' attribute).
    
    style puzzle;
      room_colour = &quot;grey&quot;;
    endstyle puzzle;
</PRE>

<P>

And here's the 'special' style:


<P>

<PRE>    # Link 'special' style (was previously the 'special' attribute).
    
    style special;
      ps link_dashed = 1;
      tk link_colour = &quot;blue&quot;;
    endstyle special;
</PRE>

<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="LANGUAGE">LANGUAGE

</A></H1>
This section gives a formal description of the <STRONG>IFM</STRONG> input language.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Symbols">Symbols

</A></H2>
In the following sections, these symbols are used:


<P>

<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_ID">ID

</A></STRONG><DD>
A name starting with a letter, followed by any combination of upper- or
lowercase letters or numbers or an underscore. E.g. <STRONG>Dense_Forest</STRONG>. IDs are not allowed to clash with reserved words (e.g. 'room', or 'tag').
One way to avoid this is to capitalize all tags (reserved words are all in
lowercase).


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_STRING">STRING

</A></STRONG><DD>
Any sequence of characters, in double-quotes. E.g. <STRONG>"Black Rod"</STRONG>. To get a double-quote inside a string, quote it by using a backslash,
like this:
<STRONG>"Ground Floor, \"A\" Block"</STRONG>. To get a backslash inside a string, quote that too (<STRONG>\\</STRONG>). You can continue strings on several lines -- a newline-and-whitespace
sequence is translated into a single space, just like in <STRONG>TADS</STRONG> and <STRONG>Inform</STRONG>.


<P>

Note that dollars ($) are special inside strings -- they mark the start of
a variable substitution. See <A HREF="#Variables">Variables</A> for details. If you want a literal dollar symbol in a string, use $$.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_NUMBER">NUMBER

</A></STRONG><DD>
An number, or an arithmetic expression (see <A HREF="#Expressions">Expressions</A>). If the context requires an integer, the number is silently rounded to
the largest integer not greater than this value.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_COMPASS">COMPASS

</A></STRONG><DD>
A compass direction, which can be abbreviated or in full (e.g. 'n', 'se',
'northwest', etc).


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_OTHERDIR">OTHERDIR

</A></STRONG><DD>
One of 'up', 'down', 'in', or 'out'.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item__">[...]

</A></STRONG><DD>
An optional part.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_thing1">thing1 | thing2

</A></STRONG><DD>
A choice of several different things.


<P>

</DL>
<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Format">Format

</A></H2>
<STRONG>IFM</STRONG> generally has a free-format layout -- i.e. whitespace may be placed
anywhere to increase readability. The only exception is inside quoted
strings, where spaces are significant. Comments may be added, starting with
a hash (<STRONG>#</STRONG>) and continuing to the end of the line. All commands are terminated with a
semi-colon.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Control">Control

</A></H2>
The overall title of the map may be set using the command


<P>

<PRE>    title STRING;
</PRE>

<P>

If a map has several sections, you can set the title of each section using
the command


<P>

<PRE>    map STRING;
</PRE>

<P>

This sets the title of the next map section. Also, any variables set after
this command are local to the next map section (see <A HREF="#Variables">Variables</A>). If you use this command at all, then the number of uses should be the
same as the actual number of map sections. But note that the <STRONG>map</STRONG> command doesn't have to be near the room that starts a new map section, so
you could (for example) put all the <STRONG>map</STRONG> commands and their local variables at the start of the input.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Tags">Tags

</A></H2>
All <STRONG>IFM</STRONG> objects may be given tag names, so that you can refer to them in other
commands. Tags for different types of object are independent -- for
example, you could have a room and an item with the same tag. However, tags
for similar objects must be unique.


<P>

In many cases, you are allowed to refer to a tag name anywhere, even
earlier in the file that you defined it (as long as the tag is defined
somewhere!). Exceptions are the room 'from ID' clause (see <A HREF="#Rooms">Rooms</A>), and tags in commands that modify existing objects (see <A HREF="#Commands">Commands</A>) -- these tags must be defined before being used.


<P>

The special tag 'last' may be used to refer to the last object that was
defined (depending on the context). Also, within an individual command, the
special tag 'it' may be used to refer to the most recent object tag.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Commands">Commands

</A></H2>
There are 5 different types of object in <STRONG>IFM</STRONG>: rooms, items, links, joins and tasks. Each is created using its own
command, the general format of which is:


<P>

<PRE>    &lt;type&gt; &lt;body&gt; [attribute-list];
</PRE>

<P>

For rooms, items and tasks, <STRONG>body</STRONG> is just a string description. For links and joins, <STRONG>body</STRONG> specifies two room tags to link or join together.


<P>

Many of the attributes of objects accept a list of tags as arguments. All
of these, if specified more than once in the same object, concatenate the
lists together.


<P>

Once an object has been declared with a tag name, its attributes can be
modified by later commands referring to that tag, like this:


<P>

<PRE>    &lt;type&gt; ID [attribute-list];
</PRE>

<P>

where <STRONG>ID</STRONG> is the tag name of the object. Note that the tag must be defined earlier in
the file than it is used.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Rooms">Rooms

</A></H2>
A new room is added using the command


<P>

<PRE>    room STRING [attribute-list];
</PRE>

<P>

where STRING is a description of the room. Room attributes can be:


<P>

<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_tag">tag ID

</A></STRONG><DD>
Give the room a tag name, so that you can refer to it elsewhere.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_dir">dir COMPASS [NUMBER] [COMPASS [NUMBER]...] [from ID]

</A></STRONG><DD>
Specify the position of the room relative to the room with the given tag ID
(which must be defined before it is used). If no 'from' clause is
specified, the last defined room is used instead. There can be more than
one direction given -- the new room is placed relative to the previous one
using them. Following a direction with a number means to repeat it that
many times.


<P>

The 'dir' clause creates an implicit link between this room and the
previous one. Some of the room attributes below behave differently
depending on whether they appear before or after the 'dir' clause in the
attribute list.


<P>

If the room is given a tag name, then the implicit link will be given the
same tag.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_link">link ID [ID...]

</A></STRONG><DD>
Specify other rooms that this room links to. Note that this creates a link
with no special attributes -- use the standalone 'link' command for that
(see <A HREF="#Links">Links</A>).


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_join">join ID [ID...]

</A></STRONG><DD>
Specify rooms on other map sections that this room joins to. Note that this
creates a join with no special attributes -- use the standalone 'join'
command for that (see <A HREF="#Joins">Joins</A>).


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_exit">exit COMPASS [COMPASS...]

</A></STRONG><DD>
Indicate which other directions the room has exits in. Room exits in a
particular direction are marked on the map only if there is no link going
to or from the room in that direction.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_note">note STRING

</A></STRONG><DD>
Append a note to the room's note list.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_score">score NUMBER

</A></STRONG><DD>
Indicate that you score the specified number of points when visiting this
room for the first time.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_need">need ID [ID...]

</A></STRONG><DD>
If this appears before a 'dir' clause, indicate that you can only enter
this room after getting the specified items. If it appears afterwards, it
applies to the implicit link instead.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_after">after ID [ID...]

</A></STRONG><DD>
If this appears before a 'dir' clause, indicate that you can only enter
this room after doing the specified tasks. If it appears afterwards, it
applies to the implicit link instead.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_before">before ID [ID...]

</A></STRONG><DD>
If this appears before a 'dir' clause, indicate that you can only enter
this room before doing the specified tasks. If it appears afterwards, it
applies to the implicit link instead. Those tasks are marked unsafe.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_leave">leave ID [ID...]

</A></STRONG><DD>
If this appears before a 'dir' clause, indicate that the specified items,
if carried, must be left behind when entering the room. If it appears
afterwards, it applies to the implicit link instead.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>leave all [except ID [ID...]]

</A></STRONG><DD>
As above, except indicate that <EM>all</EM> items must be left behind. The 'except' clause can be used to omit specific
items.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_go">go OTHERDIR

</A></STRONG><DD>
Indicate that the link to this room is in the specified direction.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_cmd">cmd STRING

</A></STRONG><DD>
Specify the command you type to move to this room from the previous one. If
no 'cmd' clause is given, the command is deduced from the 'go' clause. If
that isn't specified, the command will be deduced from the 'dir' clause.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>cmd from STRING

</A></STRONG><DD>
As above, but this specifies the command to go in the other direction. This
defaults to the 'cmd to' command, if specified.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>cmd to STRING

</A></STRONG><DD>
This is identical to 'cmd' on its own, and only exists for symmetry.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_oneway">oneway

</A></STRONG><DD>
Indicate that the return journey from this room to the previous one is not
possible.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_length">length NUMBER

</A></STRONG><DD>
Indicate that the direction link to this room has the specified length
(default 1). This only affects the calculation of the 'nearest' task when
solving the game -- see <A HREF="#Tasks">Tasks</A>.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_start">start

</A></STRONG><DD>
Indicate that this is the room the player starts in. Default is for the
first room mentioned to be the start room.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_finish">finish

</A></STRONG><DD>
Indicate that entering this room finishes the game.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_nolink">nolink

</A></STRONG><DD>
Indicate that this room does not have an implicit link with the previous
one via the 'dir' clause.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_nopath">nopath

</A></STRONG><DD>
Indicate that the implicit link from this room should not be used by the
game solver.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_style">style ID [ID...]

</A></STRONG><DD>
Add a list of display styles to the room. See <A HREF="#Styles">Styles</A>.


<P>

</DL>
<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Items">Items

</A></H2>
An item is introduced using the command


<P>

<PRE>    item STRING [attribute-list];
</PRE>

<P>

where STRING is the item description. Item attributes can be:


<P>

<DL>
<DT><STRONG>tag ID

</A></STRONG><DD>
Give the item a tag name, so you can refer to it elsewhere.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_in">in ID

</A></STRONG><DD>
Set the initial location of this item. Default is the last defined room. If
there is no last room (i.e. an item was declared before any room was
declared), then this item is initially carried by the player.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>note STRING

</A></STRONG><DD>
Append a note to the item's note list.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>score NUMBER

</A></STRONG><DD>
Indicate that you get points the first time you pick this item up.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_hidden">hidden

</A></STRONG><DD>
Indicate that this item is not immediately obvious when entering the room.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_keep">keep

</A></STRONG><DD>
Indicate that this item shouldn't be dropped (no 'drop' task should be
generated).


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_given">given

</A></STRONG><DD>
Indicate that this item didn't have to be picked up when it entered the
inventory (no 'get' task should be generated). This attribute is obsolete
-- you should use the task 'give' clause instead (see <A HREF="#Tasks">Tasks</A>).


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_lost">lost

</A></STRONG><DD>
Indicate that this item wasn't dropped when it left the inventory (no
'drop' task should be generated). Normally you should use the task 'drop'
or 'lose' clauses instead (see <A HREF="#Tasks">Tasks</A>). The only use for this attribute is for items that are left behind due to
a 'leave' clause.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>need ID [ID...]

</A></STRONG><DD>
Indicate that you can only pick this item up after getting the specified
items.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>after ID [ID...]

</A></STRONG><DD>
Indicate you can only pick this item up after the specified tasks are done.


<P>

'drop' message is generated. If there's an 'until' clause, you can't
retrieve the items until the specified tasks have been done.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>drop all [except ID [ID...]] [in ID] [until ID [ID...]]

<P>

</DL>
<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Variables">Variables

</A></H2>
Various aspects of output are controlled by variables. These are set using
the following syntax:


<P>

<PRE>    [FORMAT] IDENT = NUMBER | STRING | undef [in style ID];
</PRE>

<P>

<STRONG>FORMAT</STRONG>, if specified, is the name of a specific output format -- the variable
then applies only to that output format.  <STRONG>IDENT</STRONG> is the name of the variable, and it can take a numeric or string value.
Note that setting a variable to the value 'undef' effectively removes it.


<P>

If the style clause is present, this means to only set the variable to this
value in the specified style (see <A HREF="#Styles">Styles</A>).


<P>

You can use the value of a defined variable anywhere in the input where a
number or string is expected, by prefixing it with a dollar ($) symbol.


<P>

All strings that are printed by <STRONG>IFM</STRONG> output formats undergo variable substitution -- that is, parts of the
string which look like variable references get the value of the variable
inserted. If you want a literal $ inside a string, use $$. If you want
substitution to be performed on a variable that is cuddled up to other text
that looks like part of the variable name, you must surround it with
twiddly brackets, like ${this}. Note that variable substitution only
happens when the string is output -- this happens after all other
processing, so it is the final value of the variable that will be
substituted.


<P>

Variables can have 'aliases' -- that is, other names. A variable alias is
set using the syntax


<P>

<PRE>    alias_name =&gt; var_name;
</PRE>

<P>

This has the effect that whenever variable 'alias_name' is set or accessed,
then variable 'var_name' is actually set or accessed instead. Note that if
a variable already exists with name 'alias_name', its value is hidden while
the alias is in force. Aliases can be removed by saying


<P>

<PRE>    alias_name =&gt; undef;
</PRE>

<P>

Some output formats use variables so that you can customize them. They
expect certain variables to be defined, and give an error if they aren't.
The default values for these variables are set in the initialization file
-- see <A HREF="#Output_Variables">Output Variables</A>.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Styles">Styles

</A></H2>
Display styles change how individual things are shown when output.
Currently, only map output for rooms and links is affected by styles.


<P>

<STRONG>IFM</STRONG> keeps track of the currently active list of display styles, and there are
two commands which change this list. The command


<P>

<PRE>    style ID;
</PRE>

<P>

pushes the specified style onto the style list. This style becomes the
current style. Any <STRONG>IFM</STRONG> objects declared while a style list is in force will by default be output
in those styles. Any variable setting is by default in the current style
(though you can specify a particular style using the 'in style' clause --
see <A HREF="#Variables">Variables</A>).


<P>

The command


<P>

<PRE>    endstyle [ID];
</PRE>

<P>

pops the current style from the style list. The previous style on the list
(if any) becomes the current style. The ID, if specified, should match the
ID in the corresponding 'style' command, or a warning is given.


<P>

Each display style has its own set of values for customization variables.
On output, when the value of a variable is needed for displaying an object,
the style list for that object is searched in reverse order of declaration.
The value used is from the first style to define this variable. If no style
defines it, then the default value is used.


<P>

If a style is referenced by an object but not defined anywhere in the
input, then its definition is assumed to be in a separate file, which is
searched for using the standard search path. The name of this file is
formed by adding an <EM>.ifm</EM> suffix to the style name. If the file is not found, or it does not define
the required style, a warning is given.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Expressions">Expressions

</A></H2>
Whenever a number is expected in <STRONG>IFM</STRONG> input, you can supply an arithmetic expression. An expression can be a
number or a variable value, or a combination using the following constructs
(in order of precedence):


<P>

<PRE>    ( expr )            parentheses
    expr ^ expr         exponentiation
    + expr              unary plus
    - expr              unary minus
    expr * expr         times
    expr / expr         divide
    expr % expr         remainder
    expr + expr         plus
    expr - expr         minus
</PRE>

<P>

Note that in expressions, all variables are treated as numeric. If a
variable is set to be a string and is then used in an expression, its
numeric value will be read from the string. For most strings, this will be
zero. This means that if you want to set a string variable to be exactly
equal to another variable, you can't say something like


<P>

<PRE>    string_var = $other_string_var;
</PRE>

<P>

because the right hand side is an expression, which is treated as numeric.
The way to do it is to use variable substitution in strings:


<P>

<PRE>    string_var = &quot;$other_string_var&quot;;
</PRE>

<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Include_Files">Include Files

</A></H2>
Your <STRONG>IFM</STRONG> input can include other input files too, via the 'include' directive. There
are two forms:


<P>

<PRE>    include &quot;file&quot;
</PRE>

<P>

and


<P>

<PRE>    include &lt;file&gt;
</PRE>

<P>

The first form looks for the exact file name -- either absolute or relative
to the current directory. The second form does a directory search to find
the file, using the <STRONG>IFM</STRONG> search path (which can be set via the <STRONG>-I</STRONG>
command line option or the <STRONG>IFMPATH</STRONG> environment variable).


<P>

Note that to be recognized as such, the 'include' directive must be the
first thing on a line. Note also that no semicolon is required after it.

</A></H1>
This section describes the possible error and warning messages which might
be produced by <STRONG>IFM</STRONG>, and what they mean. Note that individual output formats may print their
own errors and/or warnings. This list only covers the standard ones.


<P>

Here's the list of error messages. If any errors occur, no output is
produced.


<P>

<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_error">error: invalid repeat count

</A></STRONG><DD>
You've given a repeat count of zero or less for a string or direction,
which doesn't make much sense.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>error: no last room

</A></STRONG><DD>
You've given the very first room a 'dir' clause. See <A HREF="#Rooms">Rooms</A>.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>error: no [type] referred to by 'last'

</A></STRONG><DD>
You've said 'last' to refer to the last room, item or task that was
defined, but none of that type of object have been defined yet. See
<A HREF="#Tags">Tags</A>.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>error: no [type] referred to by 'it'

</A></STRONG><DD>
You've said 'it' to refer to the last room, item or task tag that was
mentioned in the current command, but no tags of that type of object have
been mentioned. See <A HREF="#Tags">Tags</A>.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>error: [type] tag [name] already defined

</A></STRONG><DD>
You've given two similar objects the same tag name. See <A HREF="#Tags">Tags</A>.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>error: [type] tag [name] not defined

</A></STRONG><DD>
You've referred to a tag name that hasn't been defined anywhere in the
input. See <A HREF="#Tags">Tags</A>.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>error: [type] tag [name] not yet defined

</A></STRONG><DD>
You're referring to a tag at a point where it hasn't yet been defined, in a
situation where it must be (e.g. the room 'from' clause, or a command that
modifies attributes of a previously-defined object). See <A HREF="#Tags">Tags</A>.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>error: can't modify [name] attribute

</A></STRONG><DD>
You're attempting to modify an attribute of an object which can't be
changed once it's set (e.g. a tag name). This is because it would create
inconsistencies between objects.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>error: can't link [name1] and [name2] -- different map sections

</A></STRONG><DD>
The rooms you're trying to link are on different sections of the map, and
have no spatial relation to one another. You might have forgotten to link a
previous room in the list. Or you meant to use a 'join'.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>error: can't link [name] to itself without at least one direction

</A></STRONG><DD>
To link a room to itself, you need to specify at least one direction.
Otherwise, the link goes nowhere. See <A HREF="#Links">Links</A>.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>error: links between [name1] and [name2] have differing lengths

</A></STRONG><DD>
You've defined more than one link or join between the given rooms, but
given them different values for the 'length' attribute. This isn't allowed.
See <A HREF="#Limitations">Limitations</A>.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>error: more than one task needs to follow [task] immediately

</A></STRONG><DD>
You've given two or more tasks an identical 'follow' tag. Only one task can
'follow' a given task. See <A HREF="#Tasks">Tasks</A>.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>error: [num] cyclic task dependencies

</A></STRONG><DD>
The game isn't solvable because there's one or more chains of tasks where
each must be done before the next, but the last must be done before the
first. See <A HREF="#Finding_a_Solution">Finding a Solution</A>.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>error: variable [name] is not defined

</A></STRONG><DD>
A customization variable needed by an output format is not defined. You
should only see these errors if you have modified or overridden the system
initialization file. The remedy is to define the variable somewhere.


<P>

</DL>
Here's the list of warning messages. If only warnings occur, then output is
still produced.


<P>

<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_warning">warning: attribute [attr] ignored -- no implicit link

</A></STRONG><DD>
You've given a room with no 'dir' clause an attribute that is associated
with that link (e.g. 'oneway', or 'special'). Most likely you're putting
the attribute in the wrong place -- if you want, say, a join to have one of
these attributes, you must define it using the standalone 'join' command
instead. See <A HREF="#Rooms">Rooms</A>.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>warning: link from [name1] to [name2] outside grid

</A></STRONG><DD>
The destination room for a link is not in a compass direction from the last
specified position.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>warning: rooms [name1] and [name2] overlap

</A></STRONG><DD>
The coordinates of the specified rooms are the same. See <A HREF="#Conflicts">Conflicts</A>.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>warning: room [name] crossed by link line between [name] and [name]

</A></STRONG><DD>
A link line passes through the coordinates of a room. See <A HREF="#Conflicts">Conflicts</A>.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>warning: room [name] has multiple [dir] links

</A></STRONG><DD>
More than one link connects to the specified room in a particular
direction.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>warning: can't solve game ([num] tasks not done)

</A></STRONG><DD>
The game is unsolvable according to the current set of tasks. This can be
due to part of the map being inaccessible, or <STRONG>IFM</STRONG> stupidly choosing the wrong order of doing things. Hopefully the latter
shouldn't happen very often. See <A HREF="#Finding_a_Solution">Finding a Solution</A>.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>warning: no matching style command

</A></STRONG><DD>
You've used 'endstyle' without a matching 'style'. You probably have too
many 'endstyle' commands.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>warning: unexpected style: [name] (expected [name])

</A></STRONG><DD>
You've used 'endstyle' with an argument that doesn't match the argument of
the corresponding 'style'. You might have missed out another 'endstyle'
somewhere, or have too many.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>warning: style [name] referenced but not defined

</A></STRONG><DD>
An object in your input uses the specified style, but it isn't defined
anywhere and the style definition file <EM>name.ifm</EM> doesn't exist in the search path (or if it does, it doesn't define the
required style).


<P>

<DT><STRONG>warning: [keyword] is obsolete -- use [phrase] instead

</A></STRONG><DD>
You've used an obsolete keyword. Consult the documentation and then try the
suggested alternative instead. Note that multiple uses of an obsolete
keyword only result in a single warning.
