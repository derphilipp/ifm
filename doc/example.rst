    Dark Forest
    In this tiny clearing, the pine-needle carpet is broken by stone-cut steps
    leading down into the darkness. Dark olive trees crowd in on all sides, the
    air steams with warm recent rain, midges hang in the air.

    A speckled mushroom grows out of the sodden earth, on a long stalk.

    >GET SPECKLED MUSHROOM
    You stoop to pick the mushroom, neatly cleaving its thin stalk. As you
    straighten up, you notice what looks like a snake in the grass.

    You hear the distant drone of an aeroplane.

    >EXAMINE SNAKE
    A menacing, almost cartoon-like statuette of a pygmy spirit with an
    enormous snake around its neck.

    The plane is much louder, and seems to be flying very low. Terrified birds
    rise in screeching flocks.

    >GET STATUETTE
    Taken.

    You involuntarily crouch as the plane flies directly overhead, seemingly
    only inches above the treetops. With a loud thump, something drops heavily
    to the ground.

    >LOOK

    Dark Forest
    In this tiny clearing, the pine-needle carpet is broken by stone-cut steps
    leading down into the darkness. Dark olive trees crowd in on all sides, the
    air steams with warm recent rain, midges hang in the air.

    Your packing case rests here, ready for you to hold any important cultural
    finds you might make, for shipping back to civilisation.

    The roar dies away; calm returns to the forest.

    Square Chamber
    A sunken, gloomy stone chamber, ten yards across, whose floor is covered
    with fine sandy dust. A shaft of sunlight cuts in from the steps above,
    giving the chamber a diffuse light, but in the shadows low lintelled
    doorways to east and south lead into the deeper darkness of the Temple.

    Carved inscriptions crowd the walls and ceiling.

    >EXAMINE INSCRIPTIONS
    The carvings cut deep into the rocks from which the chamber is built,
    forming swirling sinuous patterns.

    >EXAMINE MUSHROOM
    The mushroom is capped with blotches, and you aren't at all sure it's not a
    toadstool.

    >EXAMINE SUNLIGHT
    The shaft of sunlight glimmers motes of dust in the air, making it seem
    almost solid.

    >PUT MUSHROOM IN SUNLIGHT
    You drop the mushroom on the floor, in the glare of the shaft of sunlight.
    It bubbles obscenely, distends and then bursts into a hundred tiny insects
    which run for the darkness in every direction, leaving strange trails in
    the sandy floor. No trace of fungus remain.

    >EXAMINE TRAILS
    The insect trails seem to resemble one particular group of carvings on the
    wall.

    >EXAMINE CARVINGS
    You stare at a group of carvings in the middle of one wall, uncannily
    resembling the insects' trail left in the sand, and feel your hand reaching
    out in that direction.

    >PRESS CARVINGS
    The carvings slide inwards, revealing a small cavity.

    >SEARCH CAVITY
    In the cavity among the carvings is a huge iron key.

    >GET IRON KEY
    Taken.

    Stooped Corridor
    A low, square-cut corridor, running north to south, stooping over you.
    Patches of moss emit a faint green fluorescent glow, just enough that you
    can see your surroundings.
    The passage is barred by a massive door of yellow stone.

    >EXAMINE MOSS
    The moss grows in rough clumps, surprisingly thick in places. Is that a
    hint of red hidden among all the greenery?

    >SEARCH MOSS
    Something rolls from the moss onto the ground.

    >LOOK

    Stooped Corridor
    A low, square-cut corridor, running north to south, stooping over you.
    Patches of moss emit a faint green fluorescent glow, just enough that you
    can see your surroundings.

    The passage is barred by a massive door of yellow stone.

    You can also see a blood-red ruby here.

    >UNLOCK DOOR WITH KEY
    You unlock the stone door.

    >OPEN DOOR
    You open the stone door.

    >GET BLOOD-RED RUBY
    Taken.

    Lofty Shrine
    For an underground chamber, the Shrine is remarkably high, though its upper
    half is hazy and difficult to see clearly. The craggy walls are polished
    natural rock, in which tiny flecks of quartz catch the light of the
    flickering candle.

    The massive yellow stone door is open.

    A great stone slab of a table dominates the Shrine.

    On the slab altar is a flickering candle.

    Behind the slab, a mummified priest stands waiting, barely alive at best,
    impossibly venerable.

    >EXAMINE SLAB
    It's big enough to lie on, though in the circumstances that might prove to
    be a A Really Bad Idea.

    >EXAMINE PRIEST
    He is dessicated and hangs together only by will-power. Though his first
    language is presumably local Mayan, you have the curious instinct that he
    will understand your speech.

    >ASK PRIEST ABOUT RUBY
    "That is one of my people's sacred relics."

    >ASK PRIEST ABOUT SLAB
    "The King (life! propserity! happiness!) is buried deep under this Shrine,
    where you will never go."

    >ASK PRIEST ABOUT KEY
    "That has been lost for generations. My gratitude to anyone who returns it
    will be overwhelming."

    >PUT KEY ON SLAB
    His eyes dimly agleam with gratitude, the priest takes the key and conceals
    it among his rags. Then, lifting the candle, he carefully detaches a large
    lump of the mottled wax, and gives it to you.

    >EXAMINE WAX
    On closer examination, the lump appears to be an old honeycomb.

    Square Chamber

    Carved inscriptions crowd the walls and ceiling.

    Strange trails swirl on the sandy floor.

    >E
    As you move into the eastern shadows, you seem to glimpse the word SENE
    scratched on the lintel, but before you can stop to inspect it more
    closely, you find yourself in...

    Darkness
    The darkness of ages presses in on you, and you feel claustrophobic.

    Somewhere, tiny claws are scuttling.

    >E

    Darkness

    Somewhere, tiny claws are scuttling.

    The scuttling draws a little nearer, and your breathing grows load and
    hoarse.

    >S

    Darkness
    Somewhere, tiny claws are scuttling.

    The perspiration of terror runs off your brow. The creatures are almost
    here!

    >SE

    Darkness

    Somewhere, tiny claws are scuttling.

    >NE
    Sensing a slight draught you move in that direction, stumbling over
    something lying on the ground in the dark. Almost inadvertently you grab it
    before gratefully emerging into the gloomy chamber.

    Square Chamber

    Carved inscriptions crowd the walls and ceiling.

    Strange trails swirl on the sandy floor.

    >I
    You are carrying:
      a silver bangle
      a lump of wax
      a blood-red ruby
      a pygmy statuette

    Dark Forest

    Your packing case rests here, ready for you to hold any important cultural
    finds you might make, for shipping back to civilisation.

    >PUT STATUETTE IN CASE

    >PUT WAX IN CASE
    Safely packed away.

    The case is full, and you're feeling really homesick. Now, how to get out
    of here?

    A deep throbbing noise can be heard.

    [Your score has just gone up by forty points.]

    >WAIT
    Time passes.

    A helicopter appears, hovering overhead.

    >WAIT
    Time passes.

    The helicopter lowers a rope; you tie it around the packing case, which is
    hauled up into the air, then a rope ladder comes dangling down. With one
    last look around the clearing, you climb the ladder into the waiting craft.
    Back to civilisation, and a decent pint of Brakspear's!
