=head1 OUTPUT FORMATS

B<IFM> has three different types of output (a map, a list of items, and a
list of tasks) and several different output formats.  Not all types of
output are produced by each output format.

=head2 Map Output

Maps are drawn in the classic Infocom style.  Rooms are drawn as boxes, and
links as are drawn as lines (oneway with an arrow).  Joins are marked by
adding a 'join number' to the room text of the joined rooms.  Non-hidden
items can be shown in their initial rooms.

The following output formats produce maps:

=over 4

=item PostScript (ps)

Several map sections may be printed per page.  Automatic packing is done to
try to get a good fit on the page.  Also, portrait or landscape is chosen
depending on whichever gives the best fit.  Fonts of room and item text are
scaled to fit them in the room boxes, if required.

=item Tk commands (tk)

This produces commands for input to B<tkifm>, a simple graphical interface
to B<IFM>.  It isn't very useful to produce this output yourself --
B<tkifm> does that internally to build its map pictures.  But you can
control its display by setting variables in the usual way.

=begin inf

See *note Tkifm:(tkifm). for a description of B<tkifm>.

=end inf

=item Raw data (raw)

This produces raw data intended for use by other programs.  Each entry
consists of a number of data lines, and is separated from other entries by
a blank line.  Each data line consists of an attribute, a colon, and its
value.  The attributes should be self-explanatory.

=head2 Item List Output

The following output formats produce item lists:

=over 4

=item ASCII text (text)

This produces human-readable output.  The output should be fairly
self-explanatory.

=item Raw data (raw)

This produces raw data intended for use by other programs.  Each entry
consists of a number of data lines, and is separated from other entries by
a blank line.  Each data line consists of an attribute, a colon, and its
value.  The attributes should be self-explanatory.

=head2 Task List Output

The following output formats produce task lists:

=over 4

=item ASCII text (text)

This produces human-readable output.  The output should be fairly
self-explanatory.

=item Recording commands (rec)

This output produces a list of commands suitable for feeding to IF
interpreters in playback mode.  All the commands in the output are
converted to uppercase.

In order for this to work properly, you have to give commands that the game
will understand.  The 'cmd' attribute of rooms, links, joins and tasks can
help with this.  Currently there's no item 'cmd' attribute, so you have to
make sure that the item description is recognized by the game (for get and
drop commands).  Also, if a task is implicitly done in the game without you
having to type any commands (e.g. visiting a room), you can indicate this
by using 'cmd none'.

Of course, a recording will only play back properly in an interpreter if it
provides correct game commands.  Random events can't be dealt with by
B<IFM>, and will probably cause playback to fail.  But you can work around
this with an interpreter that is able to fix the random seed at startup
(e.g. B<dumb-frotz>).  This should eliminate most (but not all) of the
problems of randomness.

=item Raw data (raw)

This produces raw data intended for use by other programs.  Each entry
consists of a number of data lines, and is separated from other entries by
a blank line.  Each data line consists of an attribute, a colon, and its
value.  The attributes should be self-explanatory.

=head2 Output Variables

There are many variables available for customizing the different sorts of
output.  Their names, descriptions and default values are all contained in
the B<IFM> initialization file.  You can change this file to set global
defaults for everybody, or alternatively set your own preferences in your
personal init file.

Here's the original initialization file that came bundled with B<IFM>.

=display ../lib/ifm-init.ifm
