=head1 LANGUAGE

This section gives a formal description of the B<IFM> input language.  In
the sections below, the following symbols are used:

=over 10

=item B<ID>

A name starting with a letter, followed by any combination of upper- or
lowercase letters or numbers or an underscore.  E.g. B<Dense_Forest>.  IDs
are not allowed to clash with reserved words (e.g. 'room', or 'tag').  One
way to avoid this is to capitalize all tags (reserved words are all in
lowercase).

=item B<STRING>

Any sequence of characters, in double-quotes.  E.g. B<"Black Rod">.  To get
a double-quote inside a string, quote it by using a backslash, like this:
B<"Ground Floor, \"A\" Block">.  To get a backslash inside a string, quote
that too (B<\\>).  You can continue strings on several lines -- a
newline-and-whitespace sequence is translated into a single space, just
like in B<TADS> and B<Inform>.

=item B<INTEGER>

An integer.

=item B<REAL>

A real number.

=item B<COMPASS>

A compass direction, which can be abbreviated or in full (e.g. 'n', 'se',
'northwest', etc).

=item B<OTHERDIR>

One of 'up', 'down', 'in', or 'out'.

=item B<[...]>

An optional part.

=item B<thing1 | thing2>

A choice of several different things.

=back

=head2 Format

B<IFM> generally has a free-format layout -- i.e. whitespace may be placed
anywhere to increase readability.  The only exception is inside quoted
strings, where spaces are significant.  Comments may be added, starting
with a hash (B<#>) and continuing to the end of the line.  All commands are
terminated with a semi-colon.

=head2 Control

The overall title of the map may be set using the command

    title STRING;

If a map has several sections, you can set the title of each section using
the command

    map STRING;

This sets the title of the next map section.  Also, any variables set after
this command are local to the next map section (see L<"Variables">).  If
you use this command at all, then the number of uses should be the same as
the actual number of map sections.  But note that the B<map> command
doesn't have to be near the room that starts a new map section, so you
could (for example) put all the B<map> commands and their local variables
at the start of the input.

=head2 Tags

All B<IFM> objects may be given tag names, so that you can refer to them in
other commands.  Tags for different types of object are independent -- for
example, you could have a room and an item with the same tag.  However,
tags for similar objects must be unique.

In many cases, you are allowed to refer to a tag name anywhere, even
earlier in the file that you defined it (as long as the tag is defined
somewhere!).  Exceptions are the room 'from ID' clause (see L<"Rooms">),
and tags in commands that modify existing objects (see L<"Commands">) --
these tags must be defined before being used.

The special tag 'last' may be used to refer to the last object that was
defined (depending on the context).  Also, within an individual command,
the special tag 'it' may be used to refer to the most recent object tag.

=head2 Commands

There are 5 different types of object in B<IFM>: rooms, items, links, joins
and tasks.  Each is created using its own command, the general format of
which is:

    <type> <body> [attribute-list];

For rooms, items and tasks, B<body> is just a string description.  For
links and joins, B<body> specifies two room tags to link or join together.

Many of the attributes of objects accept a list of tags as arguments.  All
of these, if specified more than once in the same object, concatenate the
lists together.

Once an object has been declared with a tag name, its attributes can be
modified by later commands referring to that tag, like this:

    <type> ID [attribute-list];

where B<ID> is the tag name of the object.  Note that the tag must be
defined earlier in the file than it is used.

=head2 Rooms

A new room is added using the command

    room STRING [attribute-list];

where STRING is a description of the room.  Room attributes can be:

=over 10

=item tag ID

Give the room a tag name, so that you can refer to it elsewhere.

=item dir COMPASS [INTEGER] [COMPASS [INTEGER]...] [from ID]

Specify the position of the room relative to the room with the given tag ID
(which must be defined before it is used).  If no 'from' clause is
specified, the last defined room is used instead.  There can be more than
one direction given -- the new room is placed relative to the previous one
using them.  Following a direction with an integer means to repeat it that
many times.

The 'dir' clause creates an implicit link between this room and the
previous one.  Some of the room attributes below behave differently
depending on whether they appear before or after the 'dir' clause in the
attribute list.

If the room is given a tag name, then the implicit link will be given the
same tag.

=item link ID [ID...]

Specify other rooms that this room links to.  Note that this creates a
link with no special attributes -- use the standalone 'link' command
for that (see L<"Links">).

=item join ID [ID...]

Specify rooms on other map sections that this room joins to.  Note
that this creates a join with no special attributes -- use the
standalone 'join' command for that (see L<"Joins">).

=item exit COMPASS [COMPASS...]

Indicate which other directions the room has exits in.  Room exits in a
particular direction are marked on the map only if there is no link going
to or from the room in that direction.

=item note STRING

Append a note to the room's note list.

=item score INTEGER

Indicate that you score the specified number of points when visiting this
room for the first time.

=item need ID [ID...]

If this appears before a 'dir' clause, indicate that you can only enter
this room after getting the specified items.  If it appears afterwards, it
applies to the implicit link instead.

=item after ID [ID...]

If this appears before a 'dir' clause, indicate that you can only enter
this room after doing the specified tasks.  If it appears afterwards, it
applies to the implicit link instead.

=item before ID [ID...]

If this appears before a 'dir' clause, indicate that you can only enter
this room before doing the specified tasks.  If it appears afterwards, it
applies to the implicit link instead.  Those tasks are marked unsafe.

=item leave ID [ID...]

If this appears before a 'dir' clause, indicate that the specified items,
if carried, must be left behind when entering the room.  If it appears
afterwards, it applies to the implicit link instead.

=item leave all [except ID [ID...]]

As above, except indicate that I<all> items must be left behind.  The
'except' clause can be used to omit specific items.

=item go OTHERDIR

Indicate that the link to this room is in the specified direction.

=item cmd STRING

Specify the command you type to move to this room from the previous one.
If no 'cmd' clause is given, the command is deduced from the 'go' clause.
If that isn't specified, the command will be deduced from the 'dir' clause.

=item cmd from STRING

As above, but this specifies the command to go in the other direction.
This defaults to the 'cmd to' command, if specified.

=item cmd to STRING

This is identical to 'cmd' on its own, and only exists for symmetry.

=item oneway

Indicate that the return journey from this room to the previous one is not
possible.

=item puzzle

Indicate that there is an unsolved puzzle in this room.

=item special

Indicate that the direction link to this room is special.

=item length INTEGER

Indicate that the direction link to this room has the specified length
(default 1).  This only affects the calculation of the 'nearest' task when
solving the game -- see L<"Tasks">.

=item start

Indicate that this is the room the player starts in.  Default is for the
first room mentioned to be the start room.

=item finish

Indicate that entering this room finishes the game.

=item nolink

Indicate that this room does not have an implicit link with the previous
one via the 'dir' clause.

=item nopath

Indicate that the implicit link from this room should not be used by the
game solver.

=back

=head2 Items

An item is introduced using the command

    item STRING [attribute-list];

where STRING is the item description.  Item attributes can be:

=over 10

=item tag ID

Give the item a tag name, so you can refer to it elsewhere.

=item in ID

Set the initial location of this item.  Default is the last defined room.
If there is no last room (i.e. an item was declared before any room was
declared), then this item is initially carried by the player.

=item note STRING

Append a note to the item's note list.

=item score INTEGER

Indicate that you get points the first time you pick this item up.

=item hidden

Indicate that this item is not immediately obvious when entering the room.

=item keep

Indicate that this item shouldn't be dropped (no 'drop' task should be
generated).

=item given

Indicate that this item didn't have to be picked up when it entered the
inventory (no 'get' task should be generated).  This attribute is obsolete
-- you should use the task 'give' clause instead (see L<"Tasks">).

=item lost

Indicate that this item wasn't dropped when it left the inventory
(no 'drop' task should be generated).  Normally you should use the task
'drop' or 'lose' clauses instead (see L<"Tasks">).  The only use for this
attribute is for items that are left behind due to a 'leave' clause.

=item need ID [ID...]

Indicate that you can only pick this item up after getting the specified
items.

=item after ID [ID...]

Indicate you can only pick this item up after the specified tasks are
done.

=item before ID [ID...]

Indicate you can only pick this item up before the specified tasks are
done.

=item finish

Indicate that getting this item finishes the game.

=back

=head2 Links

You can create extra room links using the command

    link ID to ID [attribute-list];

and the following attributes may be specified:

=over 10

=item tag ID

Give the link a tag name, so you can refer to it elsewhere.

=item dir COMPASS [COMPASS...]

Set the intermediate directions that this link travels in, in the same
manner as for rooms.  Note that if you omit the final direction to the
linked room, it is added automatically.

=item go OTHERDIR

Indicate that the link is in the specified direction.

=item cmd STRING

Specify the command you type to go in this direction.  If no 'cmd' clause
is given, the command is deduced from the 'go' clause.  If that isn't
specified, the command will be deduced from the 'dir' clause.

=item cmd from STRING

As above, but this specifies the command to go in the other direction.
This defaults to the 'cmd to' command, if specified.

=item cmd to STRING

This is identical to 'cmd' on its own, and only exists for symmetry.

=item oneway

Indicate that this is a one-way link, in a similar manner to the room
attribute of the same name.

=item special

Indicate that this link is special.

=item hidden

Indicate that this link should not be drawn on the map.  Hidden links are
still used when solving the game.

=item nopath

Indicate that this link should not be used by the game solver.

=item length INTEGER

Indicate that this link has the specified length (default 1).  This only
affects the calculation of the 'nearest' task when solving the game -- see
L<"Tasks">.

=item need ID [ID...]

Indicate that you can only go in this direction after getting the specified
items.

=item after ID [ID...]

Indicate that you can only go in this direction after doing the specified
tasks.

=item before ID [ID...]

Indicate that you can only go in this direction before doing the specified
tasks.  These tasks are marked unsafe.

=item leave ID [ID...]

Indicate that the specified items, if carried, must be left behind when
using this connection.

=item leave all [except ID [ID...]]

As above, except indicate that I<all> items must be left behind.  The
'except' clause can be used to omit specific items.

=back

=head2 Joins

There is a standalone 'join' command which joins two rooms on different map
sections:

    join ID to ID [attribute-list];

The following attributes may be specified:

=over 10

=item tag ID

Give the join a tag name, so you can refer to it elsewhere.

=item go COMPASS | OTHERDIR

Indicate that the join to this room is in the specified direction.

=item cmd STRING

Specify the command you type to go in this direction.  If no 'cmd' clause
is given, the command is deduced from the 'go' clause.  If that isn't
specified, the command will be undefined.

=item cmd from STRING

As above, but this specifies the command to go in the other direction.
This defaults to the 'cmd to' command, if specified.

=item cmd to STRING

This is identical to 'cmd' on its own, and only exists for symmetry.

=item oneway

Indicate that this is a one-way join, in a similar manner to the room
attribute of the same name.

=item hidden

Indicate that this join should not be drawn on the map.  Hidden joins are
still used when solving the game.

=item nopath

Indicate that this join should not be used by the game solver.

=item length INTEGER

Indicate that this join has the specified length (default 1).  This only
affects the calculation of the 'nearest' task when solving the game -- see
L<"Tasks">.

=item need ID [ID...]

Indicate that you can only go in this direction after getting the specified
items.

=item after ID [ID...]

Indicate that you can only go in this direction after doing the specified
tasks.

=item before ID [ID...]

Indicate that you can only go in this direction before doing the specified
tasks.  These tasks are marked unsafe.

=item leave ID [ID...]

Indicate that the specified items, if carried, must be left behind when
using this connection.

=item leave all [except ID [ID...]]

As above, except indicate that I<all> items must be left behind.  The
'except' clause can be used to omit specific items.

=back

=head2 Tasks

You can indicate tasks which need to be done in order to solve the game
using the 'task' command

    task STRING [attribute-list];

and these are the available attributes:

=over 10

=item tag ID

Give the task a tag name, so you can refer to it elsewhere.

=item in ID

Specify the room the task must be done in.  If this clause is omitted, it
defaults to the last defined room.  You can use the special word 'any' to
indicate that the task may be performed anywhere.  A task declared before
any room is equivalent to saying 'in any'.

=item need ID [ID...]

Indicate that the specified items are required before you can do this task.

=item after ID [ID...]

Indicate that this task can only be done after all the specified tasks have
been done.

=item follow ID

Indicate that this task must be done immediately after the specified one.
Not even a 'drop item' task is allowed in between.

=item get ID [ID...]

Indicate that doing this task enables you to get the specified items, and
must be done before you can get them.

=item give ID [ID...]

Indicate that doing this task puts the specified items straight into your
inventory, wherever they happen to be.

=item lose ID [ID...]

Indicate that doing this task causes the specified items to be lost.  This
implies that all tasks which need these items must be done before this
one.

=item drop ID [ID...] [in ID] [until ID [ID...]]

Indicate that doing this task drops the specified items in the current room
(or the room indicated by the 'in' clause) if you're carrying them.  No
'drop' message is generated.  If there's an 'until' clause, you can't
retrieve the items until the specified tasks have been done.

=item drop all [except ID [ID...]] [in ID] [until ID [ID...]]

As above, but drop everything you're carrying.  The 'except' clause can be
used to omit specific items.

=item goto ID

Indicate that you get 'teleported' to the specified room when this task is
done.  This happens after 'give' and 'drop' actions.

=item safe

Mark this task as safe -- i.e. one that can't cause the game solver to get
stuck.

=item finish

Indicate that doing this task finishes the game.

=item score INTEGER

Indicate that you get the specified score for doing this task.

=item note STRING

Append a note to the task's note list.

=item cmd STRING [INTEGER]

Specify the exact command you type to do the task.  If an integer follows
the command, do the command that many times.  Multiple 'cmd' clauses
concatenate into a list of commands.

=item cmd none

Indicate that no command is required to do this task.

=back

=head2 Variables

Various aspects of output are controlled by variables.  These are set using
the following syntax:

    [FORMAT] IDENT = INTEGER | REAL | STRING | undef;

B<FORMAT>, if specified, is the name of a specific output format -- the
variable then applies only to that output format.  B<IDENT> is the name of
the variable, and it can take an integer, real or string value.  Note that
setting a variable to the value 'undef' effectively removes it.

Note that it is not an error to refer to an unknown output format or
variable.  This is so that maps using new formats will continue to work
with old versions of B<IFM>.  One slight drawback of this is that if you
mistype a format or variable there will be no obvious way of telling -- and
no effect on your output either.

Some output formats use variables so that you can customize them.  They
expect certain variables to be defined, and give an error if they aren't.
The default values for these variables are set in the initialization file
-- see L<"Output Variables">.

=head2 Include Files

Your B<IFM> input can include other input files too, via the 'include'
directive.  There are two forms:

    include "file"

and

    include <file>

The first form looks for the exact file name -- either absolute or relative
to the current directory.  The second form does a directory search to find
the file, using the B<IFM> search path (which can be set via the B<-I>
command line option or the B<IFMPATH> environment variable).

Note that to be recognized, the 'include' directive must be the first thing
on a line.  Note also that no semicolon is required after it.
