 Building IFM on Windows
=========================

This directory is for building the Win32 distribution of IFM.  The Cygwin
tools will be needed, and here's how to do it:

1. Build IFM in the usual way (configure, make).

2. In this directory, do a ``make zip``.  This should create a directory
   called ``ifm`` here, containing all the stuff needed (including a copy
   of the Cygwin DLL, although you might have to modify the Makefile to
   point to it properly on your system).

3. Zip the ``ifm`` directory up into a zip file.  Tack the version number
   on the end to make a valid MS-DOG filename (e.g., ``ifm50.zip``).

4. Post it off to the IF archive.

5. Er... that's it.
