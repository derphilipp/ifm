 Contributed stuff
===================

This directory contains miscellaneous contributed stuff for IFM:

``asciimapper``
     Tool to create IFM maps from ASCII art maps, contributed by Elijah
     Griffin.  Intended to be an easy way to draw a map and have it
     converted to IFM format.

``ifm.vim``
     Support for IFM syntax colouring in ``vim`` (a ``vi`` clone),
     contributed by Dave Chapeskie (dchapes@ddm.on.ca).  This has been
     partially updated for version 5.x of IFM, but isn't yet complete.

``ifm-mode.el``
     GNU Emacs IFM mode.  Has syntax colouring and checking, commands to
     display maps, items and tasks, and a mode menu.

``rec2scr``
     Perl script which invokes the ``dumb-frotz`` interpreter (available
     from the IF archive) to non-interactively convert a recording of game
     commands into a transcript.  Very useful for testing the recording
     output from IFM.

``ifmpp``
     A preprocessor for any old IFM maps that made use of the ``gpp``
     directives.  Needs ``gpp`` installed.

``chess.pl``
     Perl script to write a chess board in IFM format.  One of the
     precursors to ``asciimapper`` (see above).
