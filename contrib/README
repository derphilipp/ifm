This directory contains miscellaneous contributed stuff for IFM.

ifm.vim			Support for IFM syntax colouring in vim (a vi
			clone), contributed by Dave Chapeskie
			(dchapes@ddm.on.ca).

ifm-mode.el		GNU Emacs IFM mode.  This is a really bare-bones
			major mode at the moment, and only exists so that
			syntax highlighting can work on it.

rec2scr			Perl script which invokes the dumb-frotz
			interpreter (available from the IF archive) to
			non-interactively convert a recording of game
			commands into a transcript.  Very useful for
			testing the recording output from IFM.
