This directory contains miscellaneous contributed stuff for IFM.

asciimapper     Tool to create IFM maps from ASCII art maps, contributed by
		Elijah Griffin.  Intended to be an easy way to draw a map
		and have it converted to IFM format.

ifm.vim	        Support for IFM syntax colouring in vim (a vi clone),
		contributed by Dave Chapeskie (dchapes@ddm.on.ca).  This
		has been partially updated for version 5.0 of IFM, but
		isn't yet complete.

ifm-mode.el	GNU Emacs IFM mode.  This is a really bare-bones major
		mode at the moment, and only exists so that syntax
		highlighting can work on it.

rec2scr		Perl script which invokes the dumb-frotz interpreter
		(available from the IF archive) to non-interactively
		convert a recording of game commands into a transcript.
		Very useful for testing the recording output from IFM.

ifmpp		A preprocessor for any old IFM maps that made use of the
		gpp directives.
